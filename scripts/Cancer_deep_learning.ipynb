       "array([[\" Abstract Background  Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a heterogeneous group of disorders with a number of genetic and proteomic alterations. c-CBL is an E3 ubiquitin ligase and adaptor molecule important in normal homeostasis and cancer. We determined the genetic variations of c-CBL, relationship to receptor tyrosine kinases (EGFR and MET), and functionality in NSCLC.  Methods and Findings  Using archival formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) extracted genomic DNA, we show that c-CBL mutations occur in somatic fashion for lung cancers. c-CBL mutations were not mutually exclusive of MET or EGFR mutations; however they were independent of p53 and KRAS mutations. In normal/tumor pairwise analysis, there was significant loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for the c-CBL locus (22%, n\\u200a=\\u200a8/37) and none of these samples revealed any mutation in the remaining copy of c-CBL. The c-CBL LOH also positively correlated with EGFR and MET mutations observed in the same samples. Using select c-CBL somatic mutations such as S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802* (obtained from Caucasian, Taiwanese and African-American samples, respectively) transfected in NSCLC cell lines, there was increased cell viability and cell motility.  Conclusions  Taking the overall mutation rate of c-CBL to be a combination as somatic missense mutation and LOH, it is clear that c-CBL is highly mutated in lung cancers and may play an essential role in lung tumorigenesis and metastasis.  Go to: Introduction In the US alone, each year approximately 219,400 people are diagnosed with lung cancers, out of which more than 145,000 of them succumb to the disease [1]. This number is roughly equivalent to the combined mortality rates of cancers of the breast, prostate, colon, liver, kidney and melanoma [1]. In addition the prognosis is usually poor and the five-year survival rate is less than 15%. There are also significant ethnic differences for lung cancer, and the outcome is worse for blacks compared to whites. Gender differences are also striking with women having significantly better prognosis as compared to men. There are a number of genetic alterations that can occur in lung cancer. As an example, in NSCLC, mutations in KRAS, p53, EGFR and MET have been identified. Many of these pathways, especially Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) are controlled by c-CBL.  CBL (Casitas B-lineage lymphoma) is a mammalian gene located on human chromosome 11q23.3 [2] and is involved in cell signaling and protein ubiquitination [3]. CBL proteins belong to the RING finger class of ubiquitin ligases (E3) and there are three homologues c-CBL, CBL-b, CBL-3 [4]. The c-CBL and CBL-b genes are ubiquitously expressed with the highest levels in hematopoietic tissues [5]. c-CBL consists of four regions encoding for functionally distinct protein domains: the N-terminal tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domain, the linker region, the catalytic RING finger domain, the proline-rich region and the c-terminal ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain that also overlaps with a leucine-zipper (LZ) domain [3]. Both TKB and RING finger domains are essential for ligand-induced ubiquitination of RTKs [6], [7], [8], [9]. The RING finger domain is required for the recruitment of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. The TKB domain includes four-helix bundle (4H), a calcium-biding EF hand, and a modified SH2 domain, which binds to phosphotyrosine residues [3], [10], [11], [12]. In addition, the proline-rich region of c-CBL can associate with the SH3 domain of Grb2, which can indirectly recruit c-CBL to RTKs via the GRB2 adaptor protein [7], [13], [14].  c-CBL also binds to EGFR and acts as the E3 that targets EGFR for ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore, CBL desensitizes EGF signaling and opposes cellular proliferation induced by EGF [15]. EGF activation also appears to activate the tyrosine kinase SRC, which phosphorylates c-CBL and in turn activates the ubiquitination and degradation of EGFR [16], [17], [18]. A recent study shows that defective endocytosis of EGFR is characterized by a deletion mutant and the point mutation L858R, whereby its association with c-CBL and subsequent ubiquitination are impaired [19]. Recently, the first human c-CBL mutations were reported in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients [20]. The mutation R420Q inhibits FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) internalization and ubiquitination [20].  Not only can E3 activity be important in oncogenesis, c-CBL has a dual but separate function as a signal transduction molecule. We have previously shown that c-CBL is important in binding CRKL and BCR/ABL in hematopoietic cells. Also, it can bind and modulate functions of cytoskeleton by binding to proteins like talin and paxillin. The TKB domain is important in binding to a number of molecules, and they then function in signal transduction.  Given the critical role of CBL in normal homeostasis and cancer, we hypothesized that it might be mutated in lung cancers. In this study, we report novel c-CBL somatic mutations S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802* in Caucasian, Taiwanese and African-American lung cancer patients, respectively. Expressing these mutations in NSCLC cell lines lead to increased proliferation and cell motility. We show that c-CBL mutations occur with or without MET or EGFR mutations but are mutually exclusive of a LOH at the c-CBL locus. Additionally, c-CBL LOH is associated with either MET or EGFR mutations. We thus hypothesize that c-CBL mutations might contribute to the oncogenic potential of MET and EGFR in lung cancer.  Go to: Methods Ethics Statement  Written consent on all research on human subjects has been obtained from the Institutional Review Board, University of Chicago and covers all research performed in the laboratory. The following is their contact information: Institutional Review Board, The University of Chicago, McGiffert Hall, 5751 S. Woodlawn Ave., 2nd floor, Chicago, IL 60637. Written informed consents were received from all patients whose tissue samples were used for this study.  Tissue Samples  Lung cancer tissue and paired adjacent normal lung tissues were obtained from 50 Caucasian, 29 African-Americans and 40 Taiwanese NSCLC patients who were recruited at the University of Chicago Hospital (Chicago, USA) (Caucasian and African-American patients) and Taipei Veterans General Hospital of Taiwan (Taiwanese patients) after obtaining appropriate Institutional Review Board permission and informed consent from the patients. Out of 119 samples, 77 were men, 38 were women and 4 were unknown with age at diagnosis ranging from 47 to 90 years. In terms of tumor types, 53 were adenocarcinoma, 32 were squamous cell carcinoma and 34 were large cell carcinoma. 49 were stage I, 14 were stage II, 34 were stage III, and 13 were stage IV (Table S1).  Cell Culture  Human non-small cell lung carcinoma cells A549 and H358 were maintained in DMEM and RPMI-1640, respectively. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were cultured in DMEM. Media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 µg/ml of streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were cultured at 37°C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2.  c-CBL Gene Mutational Analysis  Exons 2 to 16 of c-CBL gene were individually amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Primers are listed in Table S2. PCR conditions were 1 cycle of 95°C for 5 minutes; 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 seconds, 58°C for 30 seconds and 72°C for 2 minutes; and one cycle of 72°C for 10 minutes. PCR products were treated with ExoSAP-IT (USB Corporation, Cleveland, OH) and sequenced by Big-Dye Terminator Chemistry (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Sequencing was performed on the forward coding strand with confirmation of c-CBL alterations performed by sequencing the reverse strand as well. Chromatograms were analyzed for mutations using Mutation Surveyor v2.61 (Softgenetics, State College, PA).  Plasmid Constructs and Site-Directed Mutagenesis  The wild-type c-CBL cDNA insert was subcloned into the pAlterMax expression vector using XhoI and SalI restriction enzyme sites (Promega, Madison, WI). Using this parental plasmid pAlterMax-c-CBL, the TKB domain double mutation (S80N/H94Y), the point mutation (Q249E), and the C-terminal point mutation W802* of c-CBL were created using the following primers: 5′-GCTGGCGCTAAAGAATAACCCACCTTATATCTTAGAC-3′ and 5′-CTACCAGATACCTACCAGTATCTCCGTACTATCTTGTC-3′ for the double mutation S80N/H94Y; 5′-CTTTACCCGACTCTTTGAGCCCTGGTCCTCTTTGC-3′ for Q249E, and 5′-CAGCTCCTCCTTTGGCTGATTGTCTCTGGATGGTGATC-3′ for W802* along with their complementary primers using the QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis XL kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The constructs were confirmed for the point mutations by standard DNA sequencing of both strands.  Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) Analysis  Five microsatellites on chromosome 11 (3 on 11q at or within 200 kb up or downstream of the c-CBL gene and 2 control markers on 11p) were selected for analysis (Table S3). Established microsatellite markers and respective primer sequences were selected from the GeneLoc database (http://genecards.weizmann.ac.il/geneloc/index.shtml, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel). Primers were custom designed and each forward primer was fluorescently labeled at the 5′ end with FAM, PET, NED, or VIC (Applied Biosystems). Primer annealing temperatures and duplex scores were evaluated with NIST Primer Tools (http://yellow.nist.gov:8444/dnaAnalysis/primerToolsPage.do; National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD). Primers were verified by performing PCR with control DNA (isolated from TK6 cells) and resolving the products on agarose gels. Bands were visualized with an UV transilluminator. Genomic DNA was extracted from tumor samples and paired normal lung tissue. Primers were grouped into multiplex combinations shown in Table S4. Marker D11S929 served as an internal control to check for consistency in PCRs and of peaks from capillary electrophoresis. Multiplex PCRs were carried out in a volume of 10 µL that contained 1 µL genomic DNA (20–50 ng), 0.5 µM of each primer (1.0 µM total for each primer pair), 400 µM dNTPs, 1X PCR buffer containing MgCl2, and 0.2 U Taq DNA polymerase. PCR was performed on the ABI GeneAmp 9700 PCR System under the following conditions: 5 min at 94°C; 30 cycles of 30 sec at 94°C, 1 min at 60°C, 1 min at 72°C; and 5 min at 72°C. The PCR products were separated by capillary electrophoresis on an ABI 3130XL DNA Analyzer. Chromatograms were analyzed with Peak Scanner 1.0 and GeneMapper 3.7 software (Applied Biosystems) for allelic alterations. The area of the peaks produced by the DNA PCR products was quantified for each allele. The ratio of the allelic areas was calculated for each tumor and paired normal DNA sample. When the qLOH (allelic ratio for the tumor peaks divided by the allelic ratio of paired normal sample) was ≤0.5 or ≥2.0 for c-CBL and at least one other 11q marker in at least two separate experiments, the sample was considered as having an allelic imbalance and interpreted as LOH. Samples were evaluated in at least two separate experiments and samples showing prospective LOH at c-CBL repeated a third time which included a new control marker at the BAX locus (data not shown) on chromosome 19 to verify integrity of sample DNA.  Transfection of c-Cbl Constructs  The A549 cell line was transfected using the Fugene HD (Roche, Nutley, NJ) reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Eight µg of plasmid DNA, containing either no insert (empty vector), wild-type c-CBL, S80N/H94Y c-CBL, Q249E c-CBL or W802* CBL was used for transfection in a 6-well culture plate. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and analyzed for expression.  c-CBL Knockdown  c-CBL knockdown was performed using lentiviral transduction using MISSION lentiviral transduction particles (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) as per manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 1×105 H358 cells/well were seeded in 6-well plates and infected the following day with c-CBL lentiviral shRNA constructs. To generate stable c-CBL knockdown cell lines, cells were selected for 2 days with 1 µg/ml puromycin. c-CBL levels were determined using whole cell lysates by immunoblotting with anti-CBL antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA).  Cell Viability Assay  Cells were transfected as described above in the transfection assay. Forty-eight hours after transfection, viability of cells was assessed using Trypan Blue exclusion.  Wound Healing Assay  A549 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and cultured for 48 h until 100% confluent. The medium was then changed and the cells were transfected as described in the transfection assay. Twelve hours after transfection, a straight scratch was made across the cell layer using a 1 ml pipette tip. The cells were then gently washed with 1× PBS to remove cellular debris and the media was replaced. Photographs were taken of the wound region every 12 h until 48 h.  Western Blot Analysis  Forty eight hours after transfection, cells were collected and washed twice in 1X PBS, then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (0.5M Tris-HCl with pH 7.4, 1.5 M NaCl, 2.5% deoxycholic acid, 10 mM EDTA, 10% NP-40, 0.5 mM DTT, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 µg/mL leupeptin, and 10 µg/mL aprotinin) for 5 minutes. The lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 20 minutes at 4°C, and protein content of the supernatant was measured. Total cell lysates (50 µg/well) were separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and the gels transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman, Piscataway, NJ). Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing Tween-20 (PBST) (1X PBS, 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with the appropriate primary antibody at 4°C overnight. Membranes then were washed three times with PBST and probed with appropriate horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were again washed three times in PBST and bands were visualized using Western blot chemiluminescence reagent (BioRad, Valencia, CA) on a Chemidoc Gel documentation system (BioRad, Valencia, CA). Antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies and used at the following dilutions (c-CBL, 1∶5000; c-MET, 1∶5000; EGFR, 1∶5000; ubiquitin, 1∶1000; HA, 1∶5000 and β-actin, 1∶10,000).  Flow Cytometry  Cell cycle analysis was carried out by flow cytometry. Approximately 2×106 cells were grown in media containing 10% FBS. Cells were harvested by trypsin/EDTA treatment, washed with 1X PBS three times and fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol for 2 h. Cells were washed again with cold PBS and stained with a solution containing 25 µg/mL propidium iodide, 200 µg/mL RNase A, and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 minutes in the dark. Cell cycle analysis was performed using a Guava PCA-96 flow cytometer (Guava Technologies, Millipore, Billerica, MA).  Ubiquitin Ligase Activity  293T cells were maintained in culture in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin (100 units/mL) and streptomycin (100 µg/mL) were transfected with 0.2 µg EGFR-pcDNA3 and 2 µg HA-tagged c-CBL constructs as indicated using calcium phosphate according to manufacturer's protocol (Profection, Promega, Madison, WI). Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were starved overnight in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FBS, and then treated with or without EGF (100 ng/ml) for 15 min. The cells were collected and washed two times in ice-cold PBS containing 0.2 mM sodium orthovanadate then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X100, 10% Glycerol, 2 mM sodium orthovanadate and protease inhibitors). Lysates were cleared of debris by centrifugation at 16,000 g for 10 min at 4°C. EGFR immunoprecipitations were performed on 200 µg of cleared lysate using 250 ng of rabbit-anti-EGFR and Protein A/G Plus Sepharose overnight at 4°C. Precipitations were washed 5 times in lysis buffer before boiling in Laemmli buffer. Elutions were immunoblotted with anti-ubiquitin and EGFR. Twenty micrograms of cleared lysate were immunoblotted for each of the c-CBL constructs using anti-HA.  Statistical Analysis  Mutation rates between different groups were compared using Fisher's exact test. For continuous variables, group comparisons were performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Sidak's adjustment for multiple comparisons. Experiments involving repeated measurements over time were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA with the Greenhouse-Geisser adjustment to the degrees of freedom. Analyses were conducted using STATA (v10.1) software (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX).  Go to: Results c-CBL Gene Mutations in Lung Cancer  To investigate the role of c-CBL in lung cancer, we analyzed its genomic DNA in tumor and paired normal samples drawn from multiple ethnicities. The lung tumor samples represented Caucasians (n\\u200a=\\u200a50), African-Americans (n\\u200a=\\u200a29), and Taiwanese (n\\u200a=\\u200a40) lung cancer patients. We designed 12 pairs of primers to sequence the coding region of c-CBL gene that spans exons 2 to 16 (Table S2). We identified 8 unique somatic mutations in c-CBL exons among 8 different patients. A variation L620F, a known SNP (rs2227988) in exon 11 was also detected. Importantly, the eight novel non-synonymous mutations were confirmed by sequencing both strands of c-CBL genomic DNA obtained from lung tumor samples (Table 1). Moreover, none of the 8 mutations were detected in the corresponding normal tissue, indicating that these were somatic mutations. Four synonymous single nucleotide variations (SNVs) were also identified but were not used further in this study.  Table 1 Table 1 c-CBL mutation analysis in 119 lung cancer patient tumor tissues. Three of the 8 novel non-synonymous mutations were located in the TKB (tyrosine kinase binding) domain (S80N, H94Y, and Q249E), one in the RING finger domain (V391I), one in the proline-rich region (72515_72517 del ATG), and three in the C-terminal region (W802*, R830K, and A848T) of the c-CBL protein (Figure 1A and Figure S1). In Figure 1B, we show model chromatograms of representative samples.  Figure 1 Figure 1 c-CBL mutations and LOH in non-small cell lung cancer. 11q LOH of c-CBL Gene  Paired lung tumor and normal lung tissue samples from Taiwanese patients (n\\u200a=\\u200a37) were investigated for LOH. Eight (21.6%) showed LOH at the c-CBL locus on chromosome 11 while 29 samples (78.4%) revealed normal allelic contribution at the microsatellite markers (Figures 1C and D).  c-CBL Mutations in Different Ethnic Groups  The c-CBL double mutant S80N/H94Y was found in the same patient and the overall mutation rate for c-CBL in lung tumors was 6.7% (8/119). The frequency of c-CBL mutation was highest in large cell carcinoma (14.7%; 5 of 34 patients) followed by squamous carcinoma (6.3%; 2 of 32 patients) and the least was observed in adenocarcinoma (AD) (1.8%; 1 of 53 patients), although these rates were not statistically significant (p\\u200a=\\u200a0.292). Mutation rates were 6.0% among Caucasians (0 of 20 in AD; 0 of 10 in SQ; and 3 of 20 in LC), 13.8% in African-Americans (1 of 10 in AD; 1 of 10 in SQ; and 2 of 9 in LC), and 2.5% (0 of 23 in AD; 1 of 12 in SQ; and 0 of 5 in LC) in the Taiwanese population. Additionally two Taiwanese patients with lung cancer (one squamous and one adenocarcinoma) had the known SNP L620F. Ethnic differences were not statistically significant, however the power to detect differences was low.  Mutations in MET and EGFR Can Be Co-Associated with c-CBL Alterations  Since East Asians with lung cancer have a higher frequency of EGFR and MET mutations in lung tumors [21], [22], we also determined mutations in EGFR and MET in the same Taiwanese cohort samples and compared the results with the observed c-CBL alterations (LOH and/or mutations). In the 37 samples tested, we did not find any overlap between c-CBL mutations and c-CBL LOH (Figure 2). Of the three c-CBL mutants (including the known L620F SNP, rs2227988), one of the samples had a MET mutation (N375S) and the other had an EGFR mutation (L858R). Among the 8 samples that had a LOH at the c-CBL locus 5 had an additional mutation in MET (N375S) and 2 had an EGFR exon 19 deletion. Twenty-six samples had neither c-CBL mutation nor c-CBL LOH (3 patients had a c-CBL mutation but no c-CBL LOH). Among these 26 samples 9 had a MET mutation (8 N375S, 1 L211W), 13 had an EGFR mutation (7 exon 9 deletion, 6 L858R) and 4 had no other MET or EGFR mutation. Thus the rate of MET or EGFR mutations among patients with LOH at the c-CBL locus (7 of 8) was similar to that seen in patients without c-CBL mutation or LOH (22 of 26 patients) (p\\u200a=\\u200a0.99). These 4 patients with no identifiable mutation in c-CBL, MET or EGFR represented 10.8% of the 37 patients analyzed in the Taiwanese patient cohort. Conversely, 89.2% Taiwanese lung cancer patients have an identifiable mutation in either c-CBL, MET or EGFR or a combination of the three genes (Figure 2). Additionally, we determined p53 and KRAS mutations in these Taiwanese cohorts. Two p53 and 1 KRAS mutation were detected. The single KRAS mutation overlapped with one p53 mutation. This patient also had the EGFR exon 19 deletion but had no c-CBL mutation. The other p53 mutation sample had a c-CBL LOH with concurrent MET N375S mutation. Thus, in the Taiwanese samples analyzed, p53/KRAS mutations and c-CBL mutations were mutually exclusive (data not shown).  Figure 2 Figure 2 c-CBL mutations and relationship to MET and EGFR mutations in lung cancer. Cellular Functions of c-CBL Alterations in the Context of Lung Tumorigenesis  A. E3 activity is intact in the mutant c-CBL proteins To investigate whether the different c-CBL mutations affect the E3 activity, EGFR was chosen as a model substrate for c-CBL E3 function. All of the c-CBL mutants tested enhanced ubiquitination of the activated EGFR similar to the wild-type c-CBL protein. This result demonstrates that the catalytic activity of the c-CBL mutants is not impaired when EGFR was the substrate. (Figure 3A).  Figure 3 Figure 3 Ubiquitination, viability, expression and cell cycle analysis of various c-CBL mutants. B. Effect on lung cancer cell viability The effect of a representative c-CBL mutant from each of the three ethnic backgrounds on lung cancer cell viability in cell lines was determined. S80N/H94Y double mutation, Q249E, and W802* were identified in lung tumor samples obtained from a Caucasian, a Taiwanese and an African-American, respectively. As described in methods, the c-CBL wild-type (WT) and the above three mutants were expressed after cloning them into pAlterMax vector in A549 cells. These cells express relatively low basal levels of endogenous c-CBL (data not shown). Transfection efficiency was comparable between different groups and the number of cells transfected with c-CBL wild-type construct was about 70% compared to control cells that were transfected with the empty vector. Cells transfected with S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802* c-CBL mutant constructs resulted in increased number of viable cells that was 132.3%, 120.8% and 147.9% higher respectively, relative to the empty vector control transfected cells and significantly different from the wild-type construct (p\\u200a=\\u200a0.022, p\\u200a=\\u200a0.049, and p\\u200a=\\u200a0.008, respectively) (Figure 3B). Relative levels of c-CBL protein in whole cell lysates prepared from samples obtained from a parallel experiment was determined. The c-CBL protein levels in samples representing untransfected and empty vector transfected cells were comparable and those representing the c-CBL WT and the three c-CBL mutants were comparable (Figure 3C).  C. Effect on cell cycle To investigate if the increases in cell viability in different c-CBL mutants are due to increased cellular proliferation, a cell cycle analysis was performed. A549 cells were transfected with the c-CBL WT or the three different mutants: S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802*. The empty vector transfectant was used as a control. Forty-eight hours after transfection cell cycle analysis was performed as described in materials and methods. There was no significant change in the subG1, G1 or the S phase of the cell cycle among the different mutants compared to the WT construct (p\\u200a=\\u200a0.64, p\\u200a=\\u200a0.40, and p\\u200a=\\u200a0.28, respectively). The G2/M phase of the cell cycle showed an increase in cell numbers for the three mutants, S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802*, when compared to the WT but again the difference was not statistically significant (p\\u200a=\\u200a0.25) (Figure 3D).  D. Effect on cell motility To investigate the effect of the expression of the above three c-CBL mutants on cell migration, we carried out wound healing assay as described in materials and methods. The closing of the scratch or the wound was monitored at 0, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h. (Figure 4A). In all the samples, that represented cells transfected with mutants, the wound gap was much smaller than that seen in the sample that represented cells transfected with c-CBL WT (p<0.001). We also determined the rate of wound closure for all the five groups. At 48 h, wild-type c-CBL transfectants showed 61.1% open wound while the S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802* mutants showed 18.7%, 23.9% and 34.3% open wound respectively (p<0.001) (Figure 4B).  Figure 4 Figure 4 c-CBL mutations affect wound healing in A549 cells. E. c-CBL knockdown increases cell viability It is hypothesized that the LOH seen in our samples could lead to decreased expression of c-CBL. Thus we tested the effect of c-CBL knockdown in lung cancer cells. Compared to A549, H358 lung cancer cells express relatively high levels of endogenous c-CBL (data not shown). c-CBL expression was knocked down using lentiviral construct that expressed c-CBL specific shRNA and compared the results with those that were transduced with scrambled shRNA and the results are shown in Figure 5. We identified several clones that revealed varying degrees of c-CBL knockdown showing different sets of c-CBL lentiviral shRNA knockdown efficiency (Figure 5A). Of all the clones tested, Clone 27 was chosen for further experiments. Equal amount of cells were seeded in a 6-well plate and the cell proliferation was measured at various times and the results are depicted in Figure 5B. As expected, number of cells increased in a time dependent fashion from 100 to 190% relative to scrambled shRNA as control in a span of 48 h (p\\u200a=\\u200a0.0002) (Figure 5B). The cell cycle phases in H358 cells that were knocked down with c-CBL shRNA were looked at and compared with the scrambled shRNA. There were no discernable differences between these two constructs in the different phases of the cell cycle (data not shown).  Figure 5 Figure 5 Knockdown of c-CBL using an shRNA increases cell proliferation. Go to: Discussion Our results demonstrate that c-CBL is somatically mutated (or has LOH) in lung cancers, and can significantly contribute to enhanced cell viability and motility. There was also a high prevalence of LOH with respect to c-CBL in lung tumors that harbored MET or EGFR mutation.  In the present study, we have demonstrated the occurrence of c-CBL mutations in lung cancer patients, especially with different ancestral variations. Mutations in c-CBL have been recently reported in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia and myeloid malignancies. In the AML study, the mutation R420Q located in the junction of the RING finger and the linker region inhibited FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) internalization and ubiquitination [20], thus contributing to the gain-in-function for the RTK. In addition, mutations such as H398Y, C384R, and L380P mapped to the RING finger domain and the linker region of c-CBL that is required for its E3 activity [23], [24], [25], [26], [27]. Additionally, homozygous mutations in the RING finger domain of the c-CBL gene were described as a result of acquired Uniparental Disomy (UPD) [26]. It is important to note that our results indicate LOH at 11q23 locus and these are mutually exclusive from missense mutations of c-CBL. The somatic mutations were all heterozygous. The mutations in AML led to abrogation of the E3 activity leading to prolonged RTK activation. In addition mutants located on the linker region surrounding the RING finger domain exhibited enhanced AKT signaling in response to cytokine stimulation [26]. In addition, it was shown in NH3T3 cells, that neither mutations in the RING finger nor the linker region causes transformation, however while certain mutations perturbs the ubiquitination, others affect receptor recycling and prolong kinase activity [28].  We report here c-CBL mutations that mapped not only to the RING finger domain, but also to the TKB domain, proline-rich domain and the C-terminal region, but none mapped to the linker region as reported in the AML studies described above [23], [24], [25], [26], [29]. In addition, 8 mutants that we detected were found in different ethnic backgrounds. For example, S80N/H94Y, Q249E, W802* were detected in Caucasians, Taiwanese and African-Americans, respectively. The results point out not only the difference between lung cancer and other cancers, but also genetic polymorphism among different races in the same cancer. Interestingly, there is a large disparity between African-American and other ethnic populations with lung cancer [30]. We have previously shown that there was a low frequency of EGFR and MET mutation in African-Americans as compared with Taiwanese and Caucasians [31]. In this study, the number of African-American samples analyzed was relatively fewer and we found 3 mutations that are unique to this ethnicity. It would now behoove us to further study the genetic alterations that can occur and determine the targeted therapeutics for African-Americans. Our results provide evidence of the importance of c-CBL in tumorigenesis and potential signaling. Our prediction, based on the AML data, would be that the V391I RING finger domain mutation would affect the E3 activity. Also, it will be important to determine the binding partners for c-CBL in the TKB domain and proline rich domain mutations. It has previously been shown that the TKB domain can bind to growth factor receptors and it will be important to determine the cross-binding of these mutants to MET and or EGFR. It would also be important in the future to look at fluorescence in situ hybridization/copy number changes in c-CBL in lung cancer.  c-CBL plays an important role in down regulating RTK-mediated signaling through K63 poly-ubiquitination and subsequent downregulation of RTKs followed by lysosomal degredation [3]. Mono-ubiquitination or ubiquitinated with K63-linked chains of substrates by c-CBL may lead to enhancement of biological and biochemical functions (reviewed in Hermann et al, 2007 [32]). The mutations that we analyzed in our studies all point out to the fact that the E3 activity of c-CBL on EGFR is intact; the EGFR levels in the various mutants remain same (Figure S2). Multiple kinases, both RTKs and non-RTKs could be acted upon by c-CBL, including ERBs, PDGFR, FMS, MET, c-Kit, VEGFR, FLT-1, RON, FGFR, IR, as well as SYK, FYN, LCK, FGR, LYN and c-ABL [3]. In lung cancers the relevant substrates of c-CBL in terms of degradation or signal transduction are yet to be identified.  The observation that c-CBL somatic mutations, especially S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802* showed increased cell viability and cell motility that is in agreement with the physiological role for D-cbl in the regulation of apoptosis and differentiation identified in Drosophila is very significant [33]. It has been previously shown that activating c-CBL mutation downregulates EGFR signaling and decreases cellular proliferation and migration in breast cancer cell lines [34]. Although the role of c-CBL in the negative regulation of RTKs is well substantiated, thereby suggesting that it is a natural tumor suppressor, studies in cancer cells have revealed both tumor suppressor and tumor promoting activities depending on the type of c-CBL mutation and the number of alleles at the c-CBL locus [24]. In agreement with the above, the three c-CBL mutants described here appear to have tumor growth and metastasis promoting properties. Although these mutants are outside of the RING finger or the linker region of c-CBL, their downstream effects are significant so as to cause increased proliferation and migration, but the substrate affected by these mutations are not known yet. This raises the possibility that some of the cellular functions of c-CBL are independent of its ubiquitin-ligase activity, an area that we are currently investigating. The oncogenic nature of RTKs, addiction of cancers to growth signals and given the clustering of c-CBL, EGFR and MET mutations, it is possible that the transforming effect of c-CBL mutations is most likely a combinatorial effect of the three. We also show that LOH for c-CBL was found in a significant number of samples that harbored MET or EGFR mutations. The fact that about 7% of lung tumor samples are likely to have c-CBL mutations and an additional 22% are likely to harbor c-CBL-related LOH, makes c-CBL a highly mutated molecule in lung cancer. Since LOH alone is not enough to cause a transforming event [35], [36], [37], associated mutation in the MET or EGFR locus or yet another RTK discussed above may play a role in carcinogenesis. We predict that this LOH in c-CBL results in haploinsufficiency that downplays RTK ubiquitination leading to hyperactivity of the RTKs. However, whether this is sufficient cause for tumorigenesis remains to be determined. Consistent with our hypothesis is the fact that c-cbl-/- mice have increased kinase activity in lymphocytes, but is not sufficient for tumor formation [35], [36], [37]. c-CBL LOH could also lead to increased expression of c-CBL from the other allele to compensate for a loss of an allele. Alternately, there could be some form of synergy working with reduced c-CBL levels and mutated receptors that exacerbate the phenotype of each alone.  Previous studies from our lab and others have shown that East Asians with lung cancers have relatively high frequencies of gain-of-function of mutations in RTKs such as EGFR and MET [31]. In a cohort of Japanese patients an activating MET mutation was identified in the splice region that deletes the juxtamembrane domain that is involved E3 activity of c-CBL [38]. This study also found that activation of MET is mutually exclusive of EGFR, KRAS and HER2 gene mutations [38]. We failed to detect such mutations in significant numbers in lung tumor samples obtained from African-Americans (n\\u200a=\\u200a29) and Caucasian (n\\u200a=\\u200a50) patients. One MET mutation was identified in each of the groups whereas 1 and 3 EGFR mutations were identified in the African-American and Caucasian cohorts respectively. EGFR mutations have earlier been identified as one of the key mutations affecting lung adenocarcinoma patients in a comprehensive study of 188 patients [39]. Our study encompasses different histologies of NSCLC. However, the published series did not find any mutations in c-CBL or MET unlike our study that encompassed different subtypes of NSCLC. It is important to note, we have recently shown that MET mutations in lung cancer are in majority germline [31]. We have reported earlier c-CBL mutations in a small cohort of Taiwanese lung cancer samples [40]. In our efforts to understand the ethnic differences in the lung oncogenome, we also looked at PAX transcription factors such as PAX5 and PAX8 that are highly expressed in lung cancers; however there was no preferential expression or mutations of the above genes in lung tumor samples of African-Americans. In this study, we show relatively high frequency of c-CBL mutations in lung cancers, especially in the large cell type among Caucasians and particularly among African-Americans. We therefore propose c-CBL as an efficacious target for lung cancers in African-Americans that needs to be further substantiated. This is all the more important because the prognosis for African-Americans with lung cancer, especially for men is much poorer compared to their Caucasian counterparts [41].  In conclusion, the results presented in this study demonstrate that c-CBL is frequently mutated or even lost in lung cancers. Our results support a role for c-CBL mutants that are independent of its ubiquitination activity. Given the relatively high mutation rates in c-CBL as well as RTKs such as MET and EGFR, it is likely that their combined effect could be synergistic in promoting tumorigenesis.\"]],\n",

       "array([['Oncogenic mutations in the monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) gene have been found in many tumors, but their significance remains largely unknown. Several human c-Cbl (CBL) structures have recently been solved depicting the protein at different stages of its activation cycle and thus provide mechanistic insight underlying how stability-activity tradeoffs in cancer-related proteins may influence disease onset and progression. In this study, we computationally modeled the effects of missense cancer mutations on structures representing four stages of the CBL activation cycle to identify driver mutations that affect CBL stability, binding, and activity. We found that recurrent, homozygous, and leukemia-specific mutations had greater destabilizing effects on CBL states than did random non-cancer mutations. We further tested the ability of these computational models assessing the changes in CBL stability and its binding to ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2, by performing blind CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays in cells. Experimental CBL ubiquitin ligase activity was in agreement with the predicted changes in CBL stability and, to a lesser extent, with CBL-E2 binding affinity. Two-thirds of all experimentally tested mutations affected the ubiquitin ligase activity by either destabilizing CBL or disrupting CBL-E2 binding, whereas about one-third of tested mutations were found to be neutral. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that computational methods incorporating multiple protein conformations and stability and binding affinity evaluations can successfully predict the functional consequences of cancer mutations on protein activity, and provide a proof of concept for mutations in CBL.  Keywords: CBL, driver mutations, protein interactions Go to: Introduction Whole exome sequencing of cancer patients has produced unprecedented amounts of data to analyze and interpret; these studies report a very large fraction of missense mutations which can potentially be implicated in tumorigenensis (1). Although some missense mutations can provide selective growth advantage to tumor cells (driver mutations), the large majority of them are considered to be neutral (passenger mutations). The mechanisms by which the driver variants may affect protein stability, interactions, and function remain largely unknown. Various computational methods have been developed to estimate the impacts of disease mutations on proteins but most of them exclusively use sequence features and do not explicitly utilize the protein three-dimensional structures, their physico-chemical properties and dynamics (2, 3). Many cancers are characterized by (de)activation of certain proteins which may be a result of missense mutations (4). The interconversion between active and inactive states is highly regulated in proteins and it is not well understood how these regulatory mechanisms are disrupted in cancer. The development of in silico approaches to estimate the effects of disease mutations on protein activity, stability and binding will help to define which are likely to be driver or passenger mutations. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms of their actions would allow for prioritization of potential driver candidates for better targeted therapies to design drugs which might in turn compensate for the reduced/enhanced protein stability or activity.  The monomeric Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) RING finger ubiquitin ligase (E3) represents an exceptionally difficult yet important system to study the mechanisms of cancer mutations (5, 6). Strikingly, proteins from this family play both positive and negative regulatory roles in tyrosine kinase signaling which is aberrantly activated in many cancers (5). Oncogenic mutations in the c-Cbl gene (referred to as CBL thereafter) were found in human myeloid neoplasms and other tumors (5) but the significance of these mutations and their impacts on CBL function were studied only for very few mutants (7). The mechanistic aspects of CBL cancer mutations can now be adequately addressed as several CBL structures have become available which represent the snapshots of different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1). All CBL proteins share a highly conserved N-terminus which includes a tyrosine kinase–binding domain (TKBD), a linker helix region (LHR) and a RING finger domain, while the C-terminus comprises a proline-rich region (8). The RING domain of CBL has E3 activity and ubiquitinates activated receptor tyrosine kinases which subsequently targets them for degradation (8). At the same time, since CBL proteins can bind to activated receptor tyrosine kinases via the TKBD domain, they can serve as adaptors by recruiting downstream signal transduction components such as SHP2 and P13K (9, 10).  Figure 1 Figure 1 CBL activation cycle. The structures representing the activation cycle of CBL are shown. In the inactive closed state (nCBL) the protein exists in the cytosol. Upon activation of the RTK, CBL can bind to the phosphorylated RTK (orange peptide) via TKBD ... Another aspect of CBL function which should be accounted for in modeling the effects of cancer mutations is that it can bind to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) in complex with ubiquitin (Ub) and a substrate protein, thereby facilitating the transfer of Ub from E2 to a lysine residue of the substrate (11). The crystal structure of the inactive complex of CBL with E2 (UbcH7) was solved more than ten years ago (12) while the active phosphorylated CBL-E2 (UbcH5B) complex was resolved fairly recently (13). According to the latter study, substrate binding and Tyr371 phosphorylation activates CBL by producing a large conformational change in order to place the RING domain and E2 in close proximity to the substrate. It was further confirmed that phosphorylation-induced conformational change is required for positioning of ubiquitin for effective catalysis (14).  Here we present a new approach, which aims to assess the effects of cancer mutations on stability, binding and activity of cancer related proteins. We apply computational models to four different stages of the CBL activation cycle (Fig. 1) and perform blind in vivo experiments of CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination. We show a rather remarkable agreement of experimental EGFR ubiquitination by CBL mutants with the computed changes in CBL thermodynamic stability and to a lesser extent with CBL-E2 binding affinity. The computational models not only quantitatively predict the magnitude of the effects of mutations but also shed light on the mechanisms of their action. Namely, we find that cancer mutations have greater destabilizing effects on four CBL states than random non-cancer mutations for recurrent, homozygous and leukemia mutations. Most damaging cancer mutations happen in the sites involved in Zn-coordination and in the formation of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds within CBL or between CBL and E2. Overall cancer driver mutations affect different or multiple stages of the CBL activation cycle either completely abolishing its E3 activity or partially attenuating it. The computational models based on stability and binding affinity calculations can discriminate experimentally validated driver from passenger mutations (with the exception of two mutations) and outperform several state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods aiming to predict phenotypic impacts of mutations.  Go to: Materials and Methods Computational modeling and analysis  Mapping of CBL mutations The COSMIC database (15) stores data on somatic cancer mutations and integrates the experimental data from full-genome sequencing studies. We extracted 103 missense mutations for the CBL gene from the COSMIC database (15) that could be mapped to four available CBL structures in its activation cycle (Fig. 1). Cancer mutations were classified into different classes according to the frequency of observed samples (single and recurrent mutations), zygosity (homo- and heterozygous mutations), types of cancer (leukemia and sarcoma) and the involvement of mutations in Zn-coordination (Table S1). In addition, all possible single nucleotide substitutions resulting in amino-acid changes in the CBL gene were performed to obtain a “Random” missense mutation reference set. After excluding mutations observed in COSMIC and mutations occurring on residues without known coordinates in crystal structures, we obtained 2,102 random missense mutations (Table S1). We also searched the dbSNP database (16) but found very few benign variations in the CBL gene. Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.  Model preparation We investigated the effects of mutations on four states of the CBL activation cycle: (1) closed CBL state (nCBL), (2) partially opened CBL state bound to substrate (CBL-S), (3) unphosphorylated autoinhibitory CBL bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and (4) phosphorylated CBL bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1). It was previously noted that both UbcH5B and UbcH7 can bind specifically to CBL but only UbcH5B can facilitate ubiquitination (17). The crystal structures of nCBL (PDB id: 2Y1M) (13), CBL-S (PDB id: 2Y1N) (13) and pCBL-E2-S (PDB id: 4A4C) (13) were obtained directly from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (18). Only one crystal structure of the unphosphorylated inactive state of CBL bound to E2 (UbcH7) and Zap-70 peptide (PDB id: 1FBV) (12) was available in PDB. Although sequence identity between UbcH7 and UbcH5B proteins is 38%, the structural similarity is very high with the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 1.04 Å. The unphosphorylated autoinhibitory structure of CBL-UbcH5B-S was therefore modeled based on CBL-UbcH7-S (PDB id: 1FBV) using Chimera (19). (Detailed description is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.)  Minimization procedure We applied our recently developed optimization protocol for minimizing wild-type and mutant structures (20). Heavy side chain atoms without known coordinates and hydrogen atoms were added to the crystal structures using the VMD (version 1.9.1) program (21) with models immersed into rectangular boxes of water molecules extending up to 10 Å from the protein in each direction. Wild-type protein complexes were minimized for 40,000 steps using explicit TIP3P water model. The final minimized models of wild-type protein complexes were used to produce all mutant structures and then an additional 300-step minimization for all mutant structures was performed. The energy minimization was carried out with the NAMD program (version 2.9) (22) using the CHARMM27 force field (23). For unfolding free energy calculations we applied the optimization procedure implemented in the RepairPDB module of the FoldX program (24) which optimizes the side chain configurations to provide a repaired structure. (See Supplementary Materials and Methods for more information.)  Binding and unfolding free energy calculations Binding free energy and effects of mutations on binding affinity were calculated according to the approach introduced by us earlier (20). Energy calculations were based on the modified MM-PBSA method that combined the molecular mechanics terms with the Poisson–Boltzmann continuum representation of the solvent (25) and statistical scoring energy functions with parameters optimized on experimental sets of several thousand mutations (equation 3). Binding free energy calculations were performed on minimized wild-type and mutant structures of inactive CBL-E2-S and active pCBL-E2-S states. The binding energy is defined as a difference between the free energies of the complex and unbound proteins.  ΔGbind=GCBL-E2-S-GCBL-S-GE2 (1) The change of binding energy due to a mutation can be calculated as:  ΔΔGbind=ΔGbindmut-ΔGbindWT (2) The effect of mutations on binding affinity was calculated in this work using the following energy function:  ΔΔGbind=αΔΔEvdw+βΔΔGsolv+γΔSAmut+εΔΔGBM+λΔΔGFD+δ (3) Here ΔΔEvdw is the change of the van der Waals interaction energy and ΔΔGsolv is the change of the polar solvation energy of solute in water. ΔSAmut represents a term proportional to the interface area of the mutant complex. ΔΔGBM and ΔΔGFD are the binding energy changes from BeAtMuSiC and FoldX, respectively. BeAtMuSiC (26) estimates the effect of mutations on binding based on statistical potentials.  The FoldX software program (24) was used to estimate the unfolding free energy and to model the unfolding state. FoldX calculates the effects of mutations on protein stability using an empirical force field. The BuildModel module was used to introduce a mutation, optimize the configurations of the neighboring side chains and calculate the difference in stability (unfolding free energy) between mutant ( ΔGfoldmut) and repaired native structure ( ΔGfoldWT).  ΔΔGfold=ΔGfoldmut-ΔGfoldWT (4) For comparison we used three alternative methods to predict the impacts of mutations on unfolding free energy: the Eris server (27), the Rosetta program (28) and the PoPMuSiC server (29). We also applied four additional webtools to assess the impacts of amino acid substitutions on CBL function: PROVEAN (30), PolyPhen-2 (31), MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). (See Supplementary Methods for more information.)  Go to: Experimental procedures Expression constructs  Human CBL cDNA was originally obtained from Wallace Langdon and subsequently cloned into the pCEFL expression plasmid (34). Point mutation constructs, described above, were created from wild-type CBL using the QuikChange II Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.  Cell culture and transfections  The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T, the human nonsmall cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the human cervical cancer cell line HeLa used in this study were originally obtained from ATCC and maintained in culture using DMEM (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. Cell lines were authenticated by Short Tandem Repeat (STR) analysis by using either Promega Powerplex 16 (Promega, Madison, WI) or the AmpFISTR Identifier Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and compared to the ATCC or DSMZ databases. HeLa cells were received in the lab in 2013 last authenticated on 7-30-15, A549 were received in the lab in 2015 and last authenticated on 8-12-15, and HEK293T were received in the lab in 1995 and last authenticated on 10-8-15.HEK293T cells were transfected using calcium phosphate according to the instructions accompanying the reagent (Profection; Promega Corp., Madison, WI), incubated 18 h prior to media change and grown for a total of 48 h prior to harvesting. A549 and Hela cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Transfections were allowed to incubate 6 h prior to media change, and cells were grown an additional 48 h before being harvested. Cells were starved for 4 hours and treated with EGF (100 ng/ul). Each cell-based experiment was repeated at least two times.  Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation  To harvest proteins, cells were washed twice in ice-cold Dulbecco’s PBS-containing 200 μM sodium orthovanadate (Fisher Chemicals, Fairlawn, NJ) then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 100 mM iodoacetamide [Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO], 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors [Complete tabs®, Roche Diagnostics Corp., Indianapolis, IN]). All whole cell lysates were cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 m at 4 °C. Supernatant protein concentrations were determined using the BioRad protein assay (BioRad, Hercules, CA). For immunoblotting, 20μg of whole cell lysates were boiled in a 1:1 dilution of 2X loading buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 1 mg/ml bromophenol blue, 0.3573 M β-mercaptoethanol) for 5 m. For immunoprecipitations, 150 μg of each of the whole cell lysates were incubated with rabbit anti-EGFR (Ab-3; Millipore) and with Protein A/G+ agarose beads (sc-2003; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). All immunoprecipitations were incubated overnight at 4°C with tumbling. Immune complexes were washed five times in 1 mL cold lysis buffer, then resuspended in 2X loading buffer, boiled for 5 m, then resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Protran BA85; Whatman, Sanford, MA). For immunoblot detection of proteins, the following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-EGFR (2232L; Cell Signaling), rat monoclonal high affinity anti-HA-peroxidase, (clone 3F10; Roche), rabbit anti-Cbl (sc-C-15; Santa Cruz) and mouse anti-Hsc70 (sc-7298; Santa Cruz). Horseradish peroxidase linked donkey anti-rabbit IgG (NA934V; GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ), or donkey anti-mouse IgG (NA931: GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) immunoglobulin was used with SuperSignal (Pierce Biotechnology Inc., Rockford, IL) to visualize protein detection.  Densitometric Analysis  Immunoblots were developed on HyBlot CL Autoradiography Film (Denville Scientific Inc., South Plainfield, NJ) with an X-OMAT automated processor (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY). Protein expression levels were then recorded using an Epson Perfection V750 PRO scanner (Epson Inc., Long Beach, CA) and densitometric analysis was performed using Adobe Photoshop software version 7.0 (Adobe Systems Inc., U.S.A). EGFR ubiquitination signal intensity was determined by optical density in a set area normalized against the EGFR band intensity in parallel immunoblots and expressed as a densitometric ratio of ubiquitination/EGFR levels. The mean densitometric ratio of EGFR ubiquitination, in the presence of each CBL mutation, was then assessed relative to wild-type CBL where the ratio was set at 1.0.  Go to: Results Cancer mutations impact CBL stability  We estimated the thermodynamic stability (unfolding free energy) changes, ΔΔGfold, upon mutation for closed (nCBL) and partially opened (CBL-S) CBL states (Fig. 1). These states did not involve binding to E2. The examination of the ΔΔGfold distribution for random non-cancer mutations (Fig. 2A) showed that it was very similar to experimental distributions produced by random mutagenesis on a set of different proteins (35, 36). Namely, the distribution for random non-cancer mutations was asymmetrically centered at positive energy values and there were about 10% of random mutations with highly damaging effects on CBL structures by more than 5 kcal mol−1 (Fig. 2A). Despite the presence of highly damaging random mutations, recurrent cancer mutations overall produced significantly larger destabilizing effects compared to random (p-value ≪ 0.01) for both nCBL and CBL-S states (Fig. 2A and S1, Table S2). This was not the case for single cancer mutations observed in only one patient (Table S2). Overall, the form of the ΔΔGfold distribution for recurrent cancer mutations was different from the ΔΔGfold distribution of random mutations (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p-value ≪ 0.01) whereas the distribution for single cancer mutations was indistinguishable from a random mutation distribution. However, it does not mean that all single cancer mutants can be considered passenger, as we show later, this is not the case for some of them.  Figure 2 Figure 2 (A) The distribution of unfolding (ΔΔGfold) and binding (ΔΔGbind) free energy changes for Single, Recurrent and Random class mutations on nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states (see SI for other states). Positive and negative values ... The top 25% cancer mutations with the largest damaging effects are presented in Table S3. Many of them occurred in Zn-coordinating sites while many others did not involve Zn-coordination sites. Some of these latter mutations (G415V, G413R and G415S) introduced large Van der Waals clashes with neighboring residues which could not be accommodated by side chain rearrangements, whereas other mutations (S376F, Y371D and L405P) affected disulfide or hydrogen bonds. For example, L405P located in the middle of an α-helix affected the CBL structure by introducing an energetically unfavorable kink in the helix due to its inability to donate an amide hydrogen bond.  Effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding  The outcome of mutations can be assessed by the extent of structural changes they induce. We calculated the local root mean squared deviation (RMSD) between the minimized wild-type and mutant structures around the mutated site. We found that the protein backbone in the vicinity of a mutation of the CBL-E2 complex underwent larger local conformational changes upon recurrent cancer mutations, especially for mutations occurring in Zn-coordinating site clusters, compared to random mutations (p-value ≪ 0.01, Fig. S2 and S3). In the previous section we analyzed the original closed (nCBL) state and partially opened (CBL-S) state induced by substrate binding. In this section we study the effects of cancer mutations on two other CBL states: an autoinhibitory CBL state bound to substrate and conjugating enzyme UbcH5B (CBL-E2-S) and phosphorylated active CBL state bound to substrate and UbcH5B (pCBL-E2-S) (Fig. 1) (13). Effects of mutations on binding can be in general linked with their structural locations, therefore we examined the locations of mutations and found that about one third of all cancer mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface (Fig. S4). This preference was found to be statistically significant (p-value ≪ 0.01) (Fig. S4).  It was previously experimentally shown that binding between CBL and E2 was rather weak with a micromolar dissociation constant (13). Despite the fact that the interface between CBL and E2 in the inactive state is several residues larger than in the active state, consistent with experiments, we found somewhat stronger binding between CBL and E2 for the active state of CBL (Table S4). Similarly to the impacts of cancer mutations on stability, recurrent (but not single) mutations destabilized CBL-E2 binding significantly (Fig. 2B, S1 and Table S2). Importantly, cancer mutations reduced the CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state (p-value = 0.002) (Fig. 2B) and the effects of cancer mutations on CBL-E2 binding of the active state were noticeably larger compared to random mutations even if we excluded mutations in Zn-coordinating sites (Table S2). This latter observation does not hold true for the autoinhibitory CBL-E2-S conformation.  Next, all cancer mutations were ranked with respect to their effects on CBL-E2 binding. About half of all highly damaging mutations (top 25% of most damaging mutations, Table S3) impacted both stability and CBL-E2 binding for all four CBL states. Among them, several mutations occurred in Zn-coordinating clusters and M400 and L405 sites. Another class of mutations (involving W408 and R420 sites) mostly influenced CBL-E2 binding. For example, the W408S mutation caused the largest perturbation in CBL-E2 binding of the active state by decreasing binding affinity up to 3.5 kcal mol−1 but having a moderate effect on stability of the nCBL and CBL-S states. It was previously suggested that amino acids in positions W408 and I383 constituted specificity of CBL-E2 binding and corresponded to binding hot spots (10, 12). Mutations in the I383 site are not recorded in the COSMIC database although they have a profound destabilizing effect on CBL-E2 binding for both states (see data for random mutations on the ftp site ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/panch/CBL). Another site affecting binding of CBL (R420) is a highly conserved site in the CBL family, it strongly interacts with the Q92, W93 and S94 residues of E2. It was previously experimentally verified that mutations in this site disrupted the CBL activity and could be associated with cytokine-independent growth (37). There are 24 cancer patient samples where mutations of this site (R420Q, R420L and R420P) are found and they all produce strong destabilizing effects on the active pCBL-E2-S state.  According to the zygosity annotation, there are 49 heterozygous (“Hetero”) and 27 homozygous (“Homo”) mutations (Table S1) and for the rest of cancer mutations their zygocity status is undetermined. Overall, we found that destabilizing mutations were enriched among homozygous compared to heterozygous mutations for all stages of CBL activation cycle (p-value = 0.021 – 0.035) and were more prevalent in leukemia compared to sarcoma patients (p-value = 0.000 – 0.003) (Fig. 2B, Table S2). This observation could not be attributed to the prevalence of homozygous mutations in Zn-coordinating clusters since these clusters had almost equal numbers of heterozygous and homozygous mutations. It was reported earlier that many homozygous mutations could be connected to uniparental disomy when germline heterozygosity would lead to neoplasia upon reduction to homozygosity (6, 38, 39). If some patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms had germline heterozygous mutations in CBL, then lost the wild-type CBL allele and duplicated mutant allele, it would be possible that the damaging mutant allele would be duplicated in a cancer cell with a higher probability. Indeed, human leukemia samples show the loss of the normal CBL allele.  CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination: comparing experiments with computational models  Next we randomly picked fifteen cancer mutations based on their predicted damaging status, trying to equally sample highly damaging and benign mutations irrespective to their frequencies in cancer samples, and experimentally tested the E3 activity of wild-type and mutant CBL proteins (see Methods, Table 1). As can be seen in Fig. 3A, in the presence of wild-type CBL, activation of the EGFR induced more than a 10-fold increase in the ubiquitination of the EGFR compared to empty vector (endogenous CBL levels) in HEK293T cells (compare lane 4 to lane 2 in top panel of Fig. 3A). The E3 activity of wild-type CBL was mirrored by a decrease in the levels of immunoprecipitated EGFR consistent with the targeting of ubiquitinated EGFR for degradation (compare lanes 2 and 4 in second panel of Fig. 3A).  Figure 3 Figure 3 (A) EGFR ubiquitination. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant CBL proteins along with the EGFR and hemagglutinin (HA)-epitope tagged ubiquitin. The vector control and wild-type, CBL transfectant cells were incubated ... Table 1 Table 1 Experimental relative densitometry values for HEK293T cells, predicted changes in stability (ΔΔGfold kcal mol−1), binding affinity (ΔΔGbind kcal mol−1) and comparison with other methods for 15 experimentally ... We classified all mutations into three groups (damaging, attenuating and benign) according to their experimental relative densitometry data and compared experimental data with the estimates produced by the computational models. The first group of damaging mutants included C396R, H398Q, Y371H, K382E and C381A which completely abolished CBL activity (relative densitometry was less than 10%) (Fig. 3B) and the levels of total EGFR were not decreased by these mutants (Fig. 3A). Only two of these mutants belonged to the Recurrent class of mutations. Table 1 shows predicted and experimentally verified effects of mutations on all four CBL states. All five mutants were predicted to be damaging by stability and binding affinity calculations but the mechanisms of their action were different. C396R, H398Q and C381A mutations disrupted Zn-coordinating clusters and had very damaging consequences according to the stability model for both nCBL and CBL-S states and damaging effects on CBL-E2 binding even though none of these mutations were located on the CBL-E2 interface. On the other hand, the K382E mutation did not affect Zn-coordination but destabilized the nCBL state. This, in turn, could be explained by the charge substitution that led to the disruption of the K382-E373 salt bridge within the closed state of nCBL (Figure 4 and Figure S5A). Moreover, K382E mutation had a significant impact on CBL-E2 binding due to the disruption of a salt bridge between pY371 and K382 affecting the stability of CBL in the active state (Figure 4 and Figure S5D). No significant changes were observed for CBL-S and CBL-E2-S states (Figure S5B,C). K382E mutation was previously observed in Noonan syndrome and was speculated to affect CBL stability or binding (40). Finally, the Y371H mutation not only abolished phosphorylation at the Y371 site but also had a profound destabilizing effect on all four states as evident from Table 1.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Structures of wild type (green) and K382E mutant (tan) are shown for nCBL and pCBL-E2-S states. Salt bridges are shown as dashed lines and in both cases mutation affects the stability by disrupting the salt bridge. The second group of mutants (M374V, V430M, P428L, Q249E and double mutant S80N/H94Y) maintained the CBL activity equivalent to or greater than wild-type CBL (relative densitometry of 80% or higher) (Fig. 3B). Consistent with this, the levels of the activated EGFR were also decreased in these samples (Fig. 3A). To confirm that the retained E3 activity of these mutants was not cell type specific, we transfected these mutants into the non-small cell lung cancer cell line A549 and the cervical cancer cell line Hela (Fig. S6). The S80N/H94Y and Q249E mutations were previously identified in human non-small cell lung cancers making the A549 cell line a relevant cell type to investigate the function of these CBL mutants while other cancer mutations were found in other cancer types. As in the HEK293T cells, transfection of wild-type CBL into A549 and HeLa cells resulted in a significant increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of EGFR compared to the cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. S6). The increase in transfected CBL protein compared to endogenous CBL protein was less in HeLa than in either the A549 or HEK293T cells. Consistent with this, the fold increase in EGF stimulated ubiquitination of the EGFR by wild-type CBL was smaller in Hela cells (about three fold) compared to either A549 or HEK293T cells (more than 10 fold in each). As in HEK293T cells, the Y371H mutant did not stimulate ubiquitination compared to the vector transfected control for A549 or HeLa cells (Fig. S6A and C). The CBL mutants that were fully active in HEK293T cells (Fig. 3A and B) maintained CBL E3 activity in A549 and HeLa cells (Fig. S6). Two of these CBL mutants resulted in more ubiquitination of EGFR compared to wild type CBL. For example, the Q249E mutant showed an increased ubiquitination of EGFR in 293T and HeLa cells while the M374V mutant resulted in higher ubiquitination levels in A549 and HeLa cells (Figure 3 and S6). Only V430M mutant was on the borderline with the densitometry ratio of 0.8. All mutations from the second group were predicted to be benign according to our computational models, whereas V430M, consistent with experimental data, had a borderline destabilizing impact on CBL-E2 binding (Table 1).  Finally, the third group constituted mutations (L399V, G375P, P395A and V391I) which attenuated the CBL E3 activity according to the relative densitometry data (Fig. 3B). Only one of these mutants was observed in two cancer samples while other three belonged to the Single mutation class. Concordant with this, there were intermediate levels of EGFR (Fig. 3A). G375P and P395A mutations were predicted to have partially damaging effects while V391I and L399V were classified as benign in our predictions. Interestingly, mutations from this third group affected only some of the CBL states. In contrast, the highly damaging mutations from the first group had damaging impacts on almost all CBL states.  Next we tested if the reduction in CBL ubiquitination activity was directly correlated with the effects of mutations on stability (Fig. 5A). The relationship between experimental densitometry data and ΔΔGfold was better described by an exponential dependence with correlation coefficient (R) of 0.77 and 0.78 for CBL-S and nCBL states respectively (Table S5). Indeed, the change in absorption between wild-type and mutant proteins which refers to a fraction of active mutants can be described by the Boltzmann equation relating the probability of a state with the energy of this state. A mutation may lead to damaging effects and a loss of function if it impacts at least one of the CBL functional states. Taking this into consideration we calculated the correlation between densitometry and stability changes taking a maximum of ΔΔGfold values for the nCBL and CBL-S states. As shown in Fig. 5A and Table S5, changes in stability can indeed explain the effects of mutations on CBL ubiquitination activity with high correlation of R = 0.83. For comparison, several alternative methods were applied to predict the effect of mutations on unfolding free energy, they all reported correlation coefficients ranging from 0.21 to 0.52, with only one method PopMusic reporting a statistically significant correlation of 0.52 (Table S5). The relationship between densitometry and binding affinity changes was on the borderline of significance with a linear correlation coefficient of 0.48 and 0.62 (if two highly damaging mutations were excluded) (Fig. 5B and Table S5).  Figure 5 Figure 5 (A) Comparison between experimental densitometry values (exponential model) and maximal predicted changes in stability. (B) Comparison between experimental densitometry values (linear model) and predicted changes in binding affinity of pCBL-E2-S state. ... There are various methods which predict the phenotypic effects of mutations, (30–33, 41) and some of them use structural features (31, 41). We applied four state-of-the-art independent methods to predict the impacts of mutations on CBL function: PROVEAN (30), PolyPhen-2 (31), MutationAssessor (32) and InCa (33). Some of these methods outperformed our model in classifying cancer from random mutations since they were trained to distinguish disease from neutral variants (Table S6). However, all four methods had a very limited accuracy in classifying CBL cancer mutations into those that disrupted function and those that did not. As evident from Table 1 and Table S5, all methods except for PROVEAN over-predicted damaging effects of experimentally tested mutations while PROVEAN was the only method which produced a significant correlation between the densitometry data and PROVEAN’s score (R=0.58, Table S5).  Go to: Discussion Stability-activity balance in cancer related proteins  Evolutionary selection to maintain structural, foldable and functional proteins eliminates many mutations in protein sequences. On the other hand, thermodynamic stability can be compromised in evolution to ensure certain arrangements of catalytic and binding sites, which might not be energetically optimal (36, 42). In tumorigenesis, protein stability or binding may be reduced (or in some cases increased) due to cancer mutations. As a consequence it can lead to decreased fitness at the protein level, but may confer a fitness advantage for the population of tumor cells (43, 44). However, the extent of the stability-activity tradeoff in oncogenes and tumor suppressors remains largely unknown. Using the example of the CBL protein, here we tried to elucidate the stability-activity balance and to understand whether the loss or gain of activity in cancer-related proteins can be accompanied by compromised stability or binding.  In contrast to many other computational studies, which attempt to link stability with activity by mostly focusing on one protein conformation, we performed an analysis on four different stages of the CBL activation cycle. Our predictions of changes in stability and binding were further elucidated by the experimental CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination assays. We found a strong relationship between the effects of mutations on CBL stability and experimentally obtained densitometry data (quantifying activity), while a relatively weaker correlation was observed between changes in densitometry and CBL-E2 binding affinity. It could be explained either by a less significant impact of experimentally tested mutations on CBL-E2 binding or by a limited coupling (compared to CBL stability) between CBL-E2 binding and E3 activity.  Drivers or passengers?  According to our study, about two thirds of all experimentally tested mutations either completely abolished or attenuated E3 activity, while one third of them were neutral. Trying to assess the limitations of our models, we applied state-of- the-art methods commonly used to predict functional effects of mutations. However, these methods failed to distinguish inactivating from neutral mutations as accurately as the computational models which were solely based on accounting for the effects on stability and binding for different CBL states. Indeed, many methods are not specifically designed to discriminate driver from passenger mutations within the pool of cancer mutations, but rather they perform a task of distinguishing cancer from neutral mutations.  Certainly, the large majority of all mutations detected in cancer genomics studies are likely to be neutral although the collective burden of passenger mutations may also alter the course of tumorigenesis (45). When we analyzed the distribution of all single cancer missense mutations observed in the CBL gene, their average effects on stability or binding were not found to be significantly different from the pool of random mutations. These mutations either mostly constitute true passenger mutations or their oncogenic mechanisms are not directly connected to protein destabilization. The story is quite the opposite for the recurrent mutations as they have on average significantly higher destabilizing effects than random mutations and the majority of them should be drivers. An interesting group of mutations includes those which are highly damaging but found only in one cancer sample (10% of all single cancer mutations). These mutations may represent either rare driver or latent driver mutations (46). Several of these mutations were experimentally tested and are listed in Table 1.  CBL-E2 binding in deciphering the mechanisms of cancer  Our analysis showed that cancer mutations reduce CBL-E2 binding in the active state considerably more than in the inactive state. It is in contrast to the stability-activity tradeoff reported for EGFR and other cancer related proteins (47), where cancer mutations may disrupt autoinhibitory interactions and activate the kinase (48, 49). Importantly, all mutations with experimentally tested high inactivating effects have impacts on both CBL stability and CBL-E2 binding (Table 1). In fact, the correlation between ΔΔGfold and ΔΔGbind for CBL cancer mutations from COSMIC is positive (R = 0.20 – 0.48 depending on the CBL state, p-value < 0.05). It might seem counterintuitive as some residues maintain stability by sustaining the RING-TKBD autoinhibitory interactions within CBL. This interface overlaps with the CBL-E2 interface and competes against E2 binding (13). One might think that disruption of RING-TKBD interactions and destabilization of CBL might facilitate binding to E2 and therefore lead to CBL activation. A slight activation was actually observed for two mutants, one of which (M374V) was directly located on the CBL-E2 interface. However, as we showed through the positive high correlation between stability and activity changes, this mechanism is rarely observed and the vast majority of mutations disrupt CBL-E3 activity by either destabilizing CBL and/or CBL-E2 binding or by directly affecting phosphorylation of the critical tyrosine Y371.  Overall, our results support the idea that decrease of E3 activity, of the ability to ubiquitinate receptor tyrosine kinases, of CBL stability and/or CBL-E2 binding can give a selective advantage for tumor cells. However, there are several factors that complicate deciphering the mechanisms of action of CBL cancer mutations. CBL mutations can be dominant-negative and mutated CBL might not only change the CBL E3 activity but also might affect the concentration and activity of the wild-type CBL. According to a ratiometric method to identify driver genes in cancer (1), CBL can be regarded as an oncogene since it has several mutation hot spots. On the other hand, as shown in our study and in other studies, cancer driver mutations can inactivate the E3 activity of CBL, so it can also be regarded as a tumor suppressor. Although the latter fact complicates the development of CBL targeted therapies, understanding the delicate balance among different CBL-affected pathways may facilitate the indirect drug targeting of damaged CBL proteins. The current genetics-based frameworks to analyze cancer genome-wide sequence data are necessary but not sufficient for understanding the processes of carcinogenesis and developing informed, targeted therapies. Our approach, which can be applied in general to different proteins of interest, emphasizes the importance of the physics of binding and protein conformational ensembles in deducing the mechanisms of cancer.']],\n",
