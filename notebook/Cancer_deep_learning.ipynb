       "'somatic mutations introduced into the epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr) gene in non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc) are important factors to determine therapeutic responses to gefitinib. the current diagnostic test measures the overall egfr mutation status of the cancer tissue, and may ignore the presence of nonmutated, gefitinib-unresponsive cancer cells. twenty-one nsclc patients with egfr mutations were recruited for the study. all patients were treated with gefitinib after surgical treatment. fifty to sixty areas of nsclc tumors were sampled from each tissue, and their egfr mutation states were determined by a primer extension assay. this assay discriminates between egfr mutation-positive and -negative cancer cells within a single tumor tissue. fifteen tissues consisted only of cells with egfr mutations, but the remaining six tissues contained both mutated and non-mutated cells. time to disease progression and overall survival after gefitinib treatment were significantly shorter in those patients with egfr heterogeneity (p =  and p = , respectively). a considerable proportion of nsclc contains a heterogeneous population of both egfr mutated and non-mutated cancer cells, resulting in a reduced response to gefitinib. the intratumor genetic heterogeneity of a target molecule such as egfr would be an important factor to consider when treating patients with molecular target agents. (cancer sci 2008; 99: 929–935) lung cancer is a major cause of death. in addition, because many patients are diagnosed at an advanced cancer stage, effective anticancer drugs are urgently needed. tki of egfr ( gefitinib and erlotinib) are a new entity of anticancer drugs and have the potential to improve the therapy of advanced-stage lung cancer.(1) egfr is a transmembrane protein that induces a signal transduction cascade upon ligand binding. it is activated through autophosphorylation of a tyrosine residue in the cytoplasmic domain, causing the receptor to dimerize and internalize, and triggering a cascade leading to cellular proliferation, inhibition of apoptosis, and other cancer-related activities.(2) egfr tki inhibit this cascade by blocking autophosphorylation. there have been extensive studies on the clinical effects of gefitinib. the objective response rate to gefitinib is from 9 to 19%.(3,4) patients’ characteristics, such as adenocarcinoma histology, female sex, non-smoking history, and asian race, are associated with an increased response to gefitinib, and may guide treatment decisions.(3–5) in addition, many studies have shown a correlation between somatic egfr mutations and increased responsiveness to gefitinib.(6–10) such egfr mutations are found frequently in nsclc, and are predominantly located in exons 19 and 21, corresponding to the tyrosine kinase domain. a similar correlation is also reported with erlotinib.(11,12) japanese patients with nsclc have a high proportion of egfr mutations, and these mutations have been correlated with an increased responsiveness to gefitinib.(7,10) however, there are nsclc patients with egfr mutations that have poor responses to gefitinib, suggesting that there are other factors determining responsiveness to gefitinib.(10) one of the biological factors possibly related to the responsiveness of gefitinib is genetic heterogeneity within a single tumor tissue.(13) a tumor tissue usually consists of cancer cells with different genetic alterations, and such intratumor heterogeneity could contribute to resistance to anticancer drugs. in the present report, we examined genetic intratumor heterogeneity of egfr mutations in nsclc tissues using a refined sampling method and mutation detection by primer extension. methods patients and clinical characteristics. we recruited 21 nsclc patients who were treated with gefitinib as monotherapy for postoperative recurrence. surgical resection was complete in all patients except no. 4, whose resection was incomplete due to pleural dissemination. patients had surgery between december 1996 and april 2003 and initiated gefitinib treatment from august 2002 to october 2005 at osaka medical center for cancer and cardiovascular diseases. the ethical committee of osaka medical center for cancer and cardiovascular diseases (chaired by dr hiroshi nakajima) approved the current research, and informed consent was obtained for all cases. all patients were japanese, and clinical information was obtained by reviewing patient medical records. patients were diagnosed with nsclc by histological examination of hematoxylin–eosinstained sections of the formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded primary tumor. surviving patients were censored at the date of last contact with the institution. tumor recurrences were not necessarily confirmed pathologically but were diagnosed with imaging, clinical manifestation, and laboratory examination. in patients with measurable disease, tumor responses were assessed by the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors(14) and categorized as a complete response, partial response, or no objective response. tumor response was not evaluated in two patients (patients 16 and 17) because these patients had no measurable disease. however, their diseases, which were malignant effusion in the thoracic cavity (patient 16) and pericardiac space (patient 17), were well controlled after drainage with gefitinib treatment for 30 and 450 days, respectively. time to disease progression and overall survival were calculated from the start date of gefitinib therapy to the date of disease progression or death. determination of the egfr mutation status. tumor samples collected during surgery were frozen rapidly in liquid nitrogen 3 to whom correspondence should be

cdna sequencing, and the other was used for tissue sections. total rna was purified from tumor tissues with trizol reagent (invitrogen, carlsbad ca, usa) and purified rna was quantitated and assessed for purity by ultraviolet spectrophotometry. cdna was generated from 5 μg of rna with superscript iii (invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. an egfr gene fragment covering exons 18–24 was amplified using primers 5′-ggatcggcctc ttcatgc-3′ and 5′-aactttgggcgactatctgc-3′. the amplified products were sequenced directly using the bigdye terminator cycle sequencing kit (version ; applied biosystems, foster city, ca, usa) with the abi prism 3730 (applied biosystems). after the results of the direct sequencing of pcr products for snap shot (applied biosystems), oligonucleotide primers were designed next to the mutated nucleotides. multipoint microsampling. tumors were cut into 35 μm-thick sections in a cryostat, and stained with % toluidine blue. about 50–60 areas, 104 μm2  in size including 30–50 cells, were selected randomly avoiding normal cells, and microdissected using the as lmd system (leica wetzler, germany). genomic dna was extracted from each sampled area with the qiaamp dna micro kit (qiagen, hilden, germany), and suspended with 20 μl of distilled water. a dna fragment containing the mutated or snp locus was amplified by pcr. polymerase chain reactions consisted of 1 × pcr buffer (toyobo, osaka, japan),  mm mgso4,  mm dntp each  u/μl kod plus dna polymerase and template dna in a 10-μl reaction volume. the base of interest was determined by the snap shot assay, according to the manufacturer’s guidelines with minor modifications. the snap shot assay is based on a primer-extension assay: each extension primer binds to a complementary template in the presence of fluorescently labeled ddntp and dna polymerase, and the polymerase extends the primer by one nucleotide, adding a single dideoxynucleotide to its 3′ end. fluorescent dyes used for dideoxynucleotides were as follows: a, dr6g; c, dtamra; g, dr110; and t, drox. before the snap shot assay,  μl of pcr products were treated with 1 u shrimp alkaline phosphatase (takara, kyoto, japan) and 1 u exonuclease i (takara) for 1 h at 37°c in a final volume of 10 μl, followed by inactivation of the enzymes for 30 min at 80° snap shot thermal cycling was carried out in 5 μl, containing  μl of treated pcr product,  μl snapshot ready reaction premix (applied biosystems), 1 mm extension primer, and  μl distilled water. cycling conditions were as follows: denaturation with 25 cycles of 10 s at 96°c, annealing with 5 s at 50°c, and extension with 30 s at 60° to remove unincorporated ddntp 5 μl of snapshot products were incubated at 37°c for 1 h with 1 u shrimp alkaline phosphatase in a final volume of 6 μl, and the enzyme was deactivated as described above. a total of  μl of treated snap shot reaction was denatured in  μl of distilled water for 5 min at 95°c, and was analyzed using an abi prism 3100 genetic analyzer (applied biosystems). the fragment analysis was done with genescan software (applied biosystems). the mutation status or snp base on each allele was determined from the incorporated nucleotides. because the intrinsic fluorescense intensity of each dye is different, we measured the relative fluorescense intensity ratio, and adjusted the outputs of the dna analyzer. the values used to adjust differences in the intrinsic fluorescence intensities of dyes were as follows: dr110/drox, ; dr6g/dr110, ; and dtamara/drox, . the primer sequences for genomic dna amplification and the snap shot assay are listed in tables s1 and s2, respectively. the snp loci used for control studies were selected from jsnp (a repository of japanese single nucleotide polymorphism)(15) using the following criteria: (1) they were on chromosome 16, which rarely changes in lung cancer; and (2) high frequency of the minor allele. measurement of egfr amplification. the experiment was carried out as described previously,(10) except for the primers used in egfr amplification. the sequences of the primers and taqman probe were 5′-ggaggaccgtcgcttggt-3′, 5′-tcttga catgctgcggtgtt-3′, and 5′-caccgcgacctggcagc ca-3′. control dna was purified from leukocytes of five normal individuals. the threshold of the amplification was set at three as described previously. statistical analysis. statistical analysis (kaplan–meier analysis) was carried out using spss windows version (spss , chicago, il, us). two-sided p-values were calculated using the log-rank test. results principle of the assay. theoretical and experimental studies on colorectal cancer using microsatellite instability have shown that cancer cells of the same genotype locate contiguously.(16) therefore, if a sample excised from a tumor tissue is small enough, it will contain a genetically identical population of cancer cells. if a tumor tissue consists of cancer cells with different egfr mutation states, we can differentiate them by analyzing mutation states of multiple areas. this method is quantitative, and the ratio between gefitinib-sensitive cells (egfr mutation positive) and nonsensitive cells (egfr mutation negative, wild type) can be determined simply by counting the number of areas within a tumor of each genetic type. we analyzed 50–60 areas from each tissue. it should be noted that the sampling must not be contaminated with non-cancerous cells: a pure population was achieved using laser-capture microdissection to observe tissue sections. because the amount of genomic dna is extremely limited in our study, we chose snap shot, a primer extension assay. in snap shot, oligonucleotide primers were designed next to the mutated egfr nucleotide. using fluorescent dye-labeled dideoxynucleotides, a single nucleotide was added by dna polymerase, and the mutation status was determined. first, we determined the optimal sample size to obtain unbiased pcr amplification by changing the areas excised by lasercapture microdissection. we defined the size as approximately 100 × 100 × 35 μm, which enabled four assays and contained 30–60 cells. then, we checked the quantitative ability of the pcr assay. using genomic dna from a small area and serially diluted cloned egfr cdna as a standard, we determined the amount of genomic dna recovered from one small area. we then checked the linearity of assay with various amounts of the cloned dna. the calibration curve is shown in  s1. there was good linearity between inoculated cdna and the fluorescensce peak ratio, confirming the validity of our assay. the outline of the analysis is shown in figure 1. intratumor heterogeneity of egfr mutations. as a preliminary experiment, we examined lung cancer tissues from several patients confirmed to carry egfr mutations. in one cancer tissue, we found that some areas had wild-type egfr (no egfr mutation). a typical example is shown in figure 2. using genomic dna from two areas of this tumor, we observed two peaks representing the mutated and non-mutated alleles. in contrast, sections from two other areas showed peaks derived only from the non-mutated alleles. this tumor is therefore a heterogenous mixture of cancer cells with and without egfr mutations. it should be noted that all excised areas contained only cancer cells and were morphologically indistinguishable. to exclude the possibility that the heterogeneity was an experimental artifact, we carried out the assay with two snp loci, jst003692 and jst004556, which were heterozygous, c and t, in patient no. 17. because the two heterozygous alleles were quantitatively equivalent in all cells, deviation from the equal allele frequency should be due to experimental artifacts. we sampled 60 areas taniguchi  cancer sci | may 2008 | vol. 99 | no. 5 | 931 © 2008 japanese cancer association and analyzed them using the snap shot assay. there were no areas with 0 or 100% t allele. the mean and sd of the t allele was  and , respectively, for jst003692, and  and , respectively, for jst004556. calculating from these values, the chance for 0% t allele is  × 10–5 and  × 10–7, respectively. therefore, we can exclude the possibility that the above heterogeneity ( identi- fication of wild-type egfr) was due to experimental artifacts. additionally, to exclude the possible contamination of normal cells, we determined the mutation status of p53. the analysis of bulk tissue indicated that tissue from patient no. 17 contained only the mutated p53 allele. the spots with only wild-type egfr allele also contained only the mutation p53 allele (data not shown). these spots did not contain normal cells. correlation with response to gefitinib. we then investigated tissues from 21 patients. table 1 is a summary of the clinical information for these patients. cancer tissues were classified into two groups: those consisting only of egfr-mutated cells (15 cases, group i) and those with egfr-mutated and nonmutated cells (six cases, group ii). eight tissues in group i had an equal proportion of mutated and non-mutated egfr (the median was <61%), suggesting that these cells were heterozygous for the mutated egfr gene. examples are shown in figure 3a– divergence of the ratio of egfr-mutated and nonmutated alleles among tumor sections was partly due to that introduced during the assay. we excluded the existence of other reported mutations by sequencing the amplified products. in addition, with samples from patients 17, 19, and 20, we confirmed that the lack of mutated alleles was not due to chromosome copy number variation, using snp markers to confirm that chromosome 7p was a heterozygote. the other seven tissues in group i also consisted of the mutated and non-mutated genes, but the frequency of the mutated egfr gene was higher than the non-mutated gene. examples are shown in figure 3d–f. this increase in the mutant egfr was due either to specific amplification of the mutated egfr gene or to polyploidy ( dominance of the chromosome carrying the mutated gene). the remaining six tissues consisted not only of egfr-mutated cells but also of non-mutated cells ( 3g–l). the proportion of the non-mutated cells varied from  to 100%. patient no. 21 did not contain any mutated cells: additionally we confirmed the snap shot results by dna sequencing, that is, direct and sampled sequencing of 68 cdna clones from the block used for the snap shot analysis. the discrepancy from the initial analysis was due to heterogeneity among the sample, because we used a different part of the tumor for the initial sequencing analysis. we evaluated the effect of intratumor heterogeneity on the responsiveness to gefitinib therapy by measuring time to disease progression and overall survival. as shown in figure 4, both time to progression (median of group i, 18 months; median of group ii,  months; p = ) and overall survival (median of group i, 27 months; median of group ii,  months; p = ) were significantly less in group ii. there was no significant difference both in time to progression and overall survival after gefitinib treatment between patients heterozygous for the egfr mutation (patients 1–8) and those with the dominant mutated egfr allele (patient 9–15) (time to progression, p = ; overall survival, p = ) ( s2). the number of cases with egfr amplification was four in group i and two in group ii (table 1). thus, the differences were not due to egfr amplification. discussion epidermal growth factor receptor tki are potentially effective anticancer agents, but only a fraction of patients respond to egfr tki therapy. it is important to distinguish patients who are most likely to respond. in japan, somatic mutations found in the egfr tyrosine kinase domain are the best predictive factor of responsiveness to egfr tki, although there are contradictory studies in other nations.(17,18) so far, egfr mutation status has been viewed as homogeneous within a single tumor tissue. however, we found that 6 out of 21 mutation-positive nsclc consisted not only of mutated cells but also of nonmutated cells. in addition, these patients did not respond well to gefitinib: both time to progression and overall survival after gefinitib treatment were significantly reduced compared to patients with only egfr-mutant tumor cells. non-mutated cells are likely to be unresponsive to gefitinib therapy and contribute to disease progression. unfortunately, this hypothesis is not proven due to the unavailability of tissue after treatment. in particular, it is important to examine the fraction of non-mutated cells in recurrent tumors. another possibility is that mutation-positive cells of this tissue type would not respond well to gefitinib. through the course of gefitinib therapy, patients that initially respond to gefitinib lose responsiveness. a second egfr mutation at amino acid position 790 (t790m) was found in tumors that acquired resistance to gefitinib.(19,20) it is interesting to compare the presence of t790m and egfr heterogeneity with disease progression during gefitinib therapy. however, this direct  1. outline of the analysis method. egfr, epidermal growth factor receptor; lcm, laser capture microdissection. 932 doi: /j.1349-.00782.x © 2008 japanese cancer

      "21⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓–29 the vast majority of aml1 mutations were located in the runt homology domain (rhd), which mediated its ability to bind to dna and core-binding factor β (cbfβ).  to confirm the involvement of aml1 mutations in hematopoietic disorders, we selected 2 types of aml1 mutants found in patients with mds/aml: one with a point mutation in rhd (aml1-d171n), and the other with c-terminal truncation caused by a frame-shift (aml1-s291fsx300).  after transplantation using bone marrow cells infected with retrovirus vectors harboring aml1 mutants, most of the mice that received transplants died of mds-raeb and mds/aml. considering the recent reports of the effects of retrovirus integration sites on biological results,30⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓–38 identification of integration sites may lead to the discovery of the genes involved in the induction of mds/aml in concert with aml1 mutants.  intriguingly, the enhanced expression of evi1 by retrovirus integration seemed to collaborate with aml1-d171n to induce mds/aml with the same phenotype.  moreover, we confirmed that combination of aml1-d171n and evi1 induced aml of the same phenotype with shorter latencies in the mouse bmt model. this model will allow valuable insight into the molecular pathogenesis of mds and mds/aml.   methods  vector construction  we used 2 aml1 mutants, d171n or s291fsx300, identified from case no.  5 or 27, respectively, among patients with mds/aml.25,26 these mutants are hereafter referred to as aml1-d171n and aml1-s291fs.  aml1 wild-type (wt;

r&d systems, minneapolis, mn).  the prestimulated cells were infected for 60 hours with the retroviruses harboring pmys-aml1 wt, d171n, or s291fs-ig, or an empty vector as a control, using 6-well dishes coated with retronectin (takara bio, shiga, japan) according to the manufacturer's recommendations.  then,  to  × 106 of infected bone marrow cells (ly-) were injected through tail vein into c57bl/6 (ly-)–recipient mice (8-12 weeks of age) which had been administered a sublethal dose of  gy or a lethal dose of  gy total-body γ-irradiation (135cs). we confirmed inverse repeat sequence “gggggtctttca” as a marker of junction between genomic dna and retrovirus sequence.   results  the ratio of aml1 mutant-transduced cells gradually increased over several months after transplantation  to examine the effect of aml1 mutants on the hematopoietic abnormality, we chose 2 distinct mutants, aml1-d171n and aml1-s291fsx300, which are found in patients with mds/aml. 25,26 the former has a point mutation in rhd, and the latter possesses a frameshift mutation in the c-terminal region, resulting in truncation of the authentic protein (figure 1a). ly- murine bm cells infected with retroviruses harboring aml1 wt, aml1-d171n, aml1-s291fsx300, or empty vector were transplanted into irradiated syngeneic ly- mice.  in most of mice that received transplants of aml1-d171n– or s291fsx300-transduced cells (hereafter referred to as mice/d171n or mice/s291fs, respectively), the ratio of gfp+ and ly-+ cells gradually increased over several months after the transplantation (figure 1b), but not in mice that received transplants of aml1 wt-transduced cells or control retrovirus-infected cells (hereafter referred to as mice/wt or mice/mock, respectively).  gradual increase of c-kit+ cells in the pb was also observed in the mice that received transplants of aml1 mutant-transduced cells during the observation period (figure 1c). cells positive for c-kit and gfp—that is, c-kit+ cells transduced with aml1 mutants—were morphologically blasts with high nuclear-cytoplasmic ratios (data not shown).  in fact, the percentage of blasts gradually increased in the pb of the mice that received transplants of aml1 mutant-transduced cells, especially the mice/d171n.  finally, most of mice/d171n or mice/s291fs became sick and died with latencies of 4 to 13 months after the transplantation, while mice/mock were healthy over the observation period (figure 1d).  overall survival of mice/d171n was not significantly different from that of mice/s291fs (p = . 218).  expression of the transduced aml1-d171n or aml1-s291fs in spleen cells was confirmed by western blot analysis (figure 2a).  two of the mice/wt died during the observation period.  figure 1 download figureopen in new tabdownload powerpoint figure 1 mds and mds/aml induced by aml1 mutants derived from patients with mds.

(a) howell-jolly body, polychromasia, and anisopoikilocytosis. in summary, the pattern and degree of multilineage dysplasia differed among the mice that underwent transplantation.  although both mice/d171n and mice/s291fs died of mds and mds/aml within 4 to 13 months after transplantation, a marked difference existed in terms of clinical symptoms, including hematopoietic or macroscopic findings.   a distinct type of disease was identified in mice/d171n  among the mice that underwent transplantation transduced with aml1-d171n, a distinct group was identified. gfp+ bm cells in 11 of 16 morbid mice/d171n (mouse ids 4, 6, 7, 12-15, 19, 20, 22, and 26) displayed a similar phenotype, with high percentages of cd11b+ and b220+ cells (figure 5; data not shown).  all these mice/d171n showed dysplasia in myeloid and erythroid lineages for several months and died of mds/aml with increased number of blasts, anemia, and, in some cases, thrombocytopenia (table s2).  these mice/d171n also showed severe hepatosplenomegaly (figures 3e,f, 6a; table s2), and histologic examination showed expansion of blasts and immature myeloid cells in the pb, bm, and spleen, and the invasion of these cells into hepatic portal areas in the liver and spaces among renal tubules in the kidney (figure 6b,d,f). giemsa staining of bm showed a high percentage of blasts (figure 6h), in accordance with a high percentage of both gfp/c-kit double-positive cells by flow cytometolic analysis.   figure 5 download figureopen in new tabdownload powerpoint figure 5 aml1-d171n induced a biphenotypic leukemia in concert with evi1 in the bmt model.  the dot plots show ly, gr-1, cd11b, b220, cd3, cd41, c-kit, sca-1, cd34, or ter119 labeled with a corresponding pe-conjugated mab versus expression of gf bm cells of morbid mice/d171n with high expression of evi1 (mouse ids 6, 20, and 26) and those of morbid mice/d171n + evi1 (mouse ids 302 and 305) displayed a similar pattern of surface markers, cd11b+ and b220+. figure 6 download figureopen in new tabdownload powerpoint figure 6 leukemic cells of mice/d171n with high expression of evi1 invaded into liver and kidney.

(a) southern blot analysis of mice/d171n. mouse ids are shown at the top of the panel.

(c) real-time pcr for evi1 in bm derived from morbid mice/d171n or mice/s291fs or mice/wt or mice/mock.  in addition to 6 samples from mice/d171n harboring integration near evi1 (mouse ids 4, 6, 7, 12, 14, and 15), 4 samples derived from mice/d171n without integration near evi1 display high expression levels of evi1 (mouse ids 13, 19, 20, and 22). rna from normal bm cells served as a control (rna level = 1).  (d) western blot of lysates from spleen cells of mice/d171n, mice/wt, and normal mice and plat-e as controls.  samples from mice/d171n confirmed high expression of evi1 by rt-pcr showed expression of the protein (mouse ids 6, 15, 20, and 22), but the other mice without high expression of evi1 by rt-pcr did not express the protein (mouse ids 11, 17, and 105). view inlineview popup table 1 analysis of integration site in vivo collaboration between evi1 and aml1-d171n  next, we tested to see if evi1 expression collaborates with aml1-d171n in inducing leukemia in the bmt model.  cotransduction of aml1-d171n and evi1 into bm cells resulted in rapid induction of the disease in the mice that underwent transplantation that was essentially identical with the disease that developed after a long latency in the mice/d171n (figures 1e,5).  in fact, all the mice displayed increased number of blasts in the pb within a month after the transplantation of bm cells transduced with evi1/d171n. southern blot analysis showed that these leukemic cells were polyclonal (figure 7b).  these results indicate that aml1-d171n and evi1 collaborate to induce mds/aml with a distinct phenotype.  on the other hand, cotransduction of aml1-s291fs and evi1 into bm cells did not induce mds/aml in 5 months (data not shown). in the present work, mice that received transplants of bm cell–transduced evi1 alone did not present any abnormalities in 5 months (figure 1e).   aml1-s291fs induced erythroid dysplasia with pancytopenia  in contrast to mice/d171n, most of mice/s291fs displayed remarkable erythroid dysplasia with continuous pancytopenia (figures 3a-c,4a).  a total of 2 of 8 mice/s291fs died of mds-raeb in which the percentage of blasts in the bone marrow was less than 20%, and 5 mice/s291fs developed mds/aml. the mice displayed severe anemia but not leukocytosis in the pb, and the numbers of blasts were generally lower than those of mds/aml mice transduced with aml1-d171n (table s2).  surface markers of leukemic cells derived from mice/s291fs were different from those of mice/d171n (figure s3).   we found integrations of the retrovirus in the intron of mn1 in 3 of 8 mice/s291fs (table 1; mouse ids 55, 56, and 58), and mn1 was overexpressed in the leukemic cells of these mice (figure s2). we believe that the combination of these factors has put our system into practice.   in the present mds model, we used 2 aml1 mutants, d171n and s291fsx300.  the latter, a c-terminal–truncated form, is more potent as a dominant-negative form than the former, which harbors a point mutation in the rhd.25,26 in this context, it is reasonable that the s291fs mutant induced the disease in the mice that underwent transplantation with a higher penetrance (figure 1d).  more important, expression of these mutants induced mds/aml of distinct phenotypes in the mice that underwent transplantation: aml1-s291fs induced pancytopenia associated with dysplasia in the erythroid lineage, while aml1-d171n frequently induced hepatoslenomegaly and leukocytosis associated with marked myeloid dysplasia.  this suggests that even different mutations of the same gene could induce heterogeneous diseases.  as previously described,25,26 aml1-d171n lost dna-binding ability and hence transactivation potential because it possessed a point mutation in rhd essential for dna-binding, while aml1-s291fs had increased dna-binding ability but lost transactivation potential because it had an intact rhd but lacked a c-terminal transactivation domain.  thus, the different biological outcomes induced by aml1 mutants could be explained in part by structural and functional differences between the mutants.30⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓–38 this sometimes obscures the significance of the transduced gene, but simultaneously will give us clues to understanding the collaboration of multiple genes in the development of leukemias.  one of the intriguing findings of the present work is that high expression of evi1, either caused by virus integration or by unknown mechanisms, was able to collaborate with aml1-d171n in inducing the homogeneous disease characterized by leukocytosis, severe myelodysplasia, and marked hepatosplenomegaly that always developed to overt leukemia with high percentages of b220+ and cd11b+ blasts.  together with the recent findings that evi1 expression was observed in patients with mds and aml,36,48 and that evi1 alone did not induce aml in mouse models,14,34,49,50 our result strongly suggested that aml1-d171n collaborated with evi1 in inducing mds/aml. it is interesting to note that aml1-s291fs never collaborated with evi1 during our examination (table 1), again suggesting that these 2 aml1 mutations transform hematopoietic cells through distinct mechanisms.  importantly, we confirmed the collaboration between aml1-d171n and evi1 in an in vivo experiment.  cotransduction of aml1-d171n and evi1 into bm cells resulted in rapid induction of mds/aml in the mice that received transplants.  in addition, the leukemic cells in most of these mice included more clones than those in mice/d171n (figure 7b), indicating cooperation of evi1 and aml1-d171n.  however, leukemic cells from one mouse (id 305) seemed to be monoclonal and to contribute to oligoclonal leukemia of mouse 304. in addition, it took 2 to 3 months for leukemias induced by the combination of aml1-d171n and evi1 to kill the mice that received transplants.  together, these result suggested that while aml1-d171n and evi1 overexpression collaborated in inducing leukemia, additional steps were required for efficient transformation of hematopoietic progenitors.  in the absence of evi1 high expression, aml1-d171n caused mds or mds/aml with low percentages of blasts in bm but still with hepatosplenomegaly. this indicates that hepatosplenomegaly had something to do with aml1-d171n.   in contrast to mice/d171n, most mice/s291fs succumbed to either mds-raeb with fatal severe anemia following continuous pancytopenia or mds/aml without leukocytosis.  the integration site in the intron 1 of the mn1 gene found in leukemic cells of 3 mice was derived from the same cell.  one fundamental question of this study was whether aml1 mutants alone induce mds and mds/aml.  in our experiments, 5 of the 6 surviving mice/d171n showed a disappearance of gfp+ cells in time, suggesting that aml1-d171n alone was not able to induce mds/aml.  previous studies using gene-engineered mice and a bmt model demonstrated that aml1 fusions caused by chromosomal translocations alone were insufficient to induce aml,7⇓⇓⇓⇓–12 except for aml1-mds1-evi1, which by itself induced aml with a long latency.52 in addition, several lines of evidence30⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓–38 that implicated the integration site of retroviruses for different biological outcomes led us to consider the same possibility in this bmt model.  indeed, we identified frequent retrovirus integrations near the evi1 gene in the bm cells derived from mice/d171n whose leukemic cells displayed nearly identical phenotypes and concomitant elevated expression of evi1.  importantly, coexpression of aml1-d171n and evi1 induced the same leukemia with shorther latencies, demonstrating the collaboration between aml1-d171n and evi1 in vivo. the recent finding25⇓–27 that aml1 point mutations in the c-terminal regions were almost exclusively found in mds-raeb and mds/aml, but not in de novo aml, coincided with our data that aml1-s291fs tended to induce mds-raeb–like symptoms in this bmt model.  clinical findings25⇓–27 that the rhd point mutation was often found in de novo aml, mainly aml m0, in addition to mds-raeb and mds/aml, was also in accordance with our data that aml1-d171n induced more progressive mds/aml with higher percentages of blasts when compared with aml1-s291fs.  classification of mds and mds/aml is always controversial because of the heterogeneity of the disease.\n",
