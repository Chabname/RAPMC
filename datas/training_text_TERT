27||Heterozygous mutations in the telomerase components TERT, the reverse transcriptase, and TERC, the RNA template, cause autosomal dominant dyskeratosis congenita due to telomere shortening. Anticipation, whereby the disease severity increases in succeeding generations due to inheritance of shorter telomeres, is a feature of this condition. Here we describe 2 families in which 2 TERT mutations are segregating. Both families contain compound heterozygotes. In one case the proband is homozygous for a novel mutation causing a P704S substitution, while his father's second allele encodes an H412Y mutation. The proband in the second family has mutant alleles Y846C and H876Q. Transfection studies show codominant expression of the mutated alleles with no evidence of a dominant negative effect or of intragenic complementation. Thus in these families the expression of both TERT alleles and the inherited telomere length contribute to the clinical phenotype.  Go to: Introduction Mutations in genes encoding components of the telomerase ribonucleoprotein complex resulting in very short telomeres have been identified in patients with dyskeratosis congenita (DC), a rare inherited bone marrow failure syndrome.1–6 X-linked DC is caused by mutations in the DKC1 gene, encoding a protein necessary for the stabilization of the TERC RNA. Individuals with autosomal dominant DC (AD DC) are heterozygous for mutations in the telomerase RNA TERC or the gene encoding the catalytic subunit TERT.2–5 In contrast to patients with X-linked DC, who usually develop severe disease with a high penetrance, disease penetrance and expressivity in AD DC are highly variable and, in addition to the gene mutation, the inheritance of short telomeres is required for the manifestation of the disease.7,8 Here we demonstrate that the inheritance of AD DC may be complex. We report a DC patient homozygous for a TERT mutation and compound heterozygotes in 2 separate families with apparent codominance of the 2 mutations  Go to: Methods Clinical and genetic information was obtained through our ongoing study on the molecular mechanisms of bone marrow failure (http://bmf.im.wustl.edu). The study is approved by the Washington University School of Medicine Institutional Review Board. Informed consent was obtained in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. DNA for mutation analysis was extracted from peripheral blood cells (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Telomere length measurements in peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMC) by flow-FISH and direct DNA sequencing were previously described.8 Primers used are shown in Table S1 (available on the Blood website; see the Supplemental Materials link at the top of the online article).  The mutations identified were introduced in the p3.1+ TERT plasmid9 using the QuickChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Wild-type (WT) or mutant TERT plasmid (4 μg) were transfected into WI-38 VA-13 cells at 80% confluence in the presence of an equal amount of pUC TERC using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).10 In cotransfection experiments, 2 μg of each mutant TERT plasmid were used. Thirty-six hours after transfection, telomerase activities were determined in cell lysates at protein concentrations of 40, 10, 2.5, and 0.625 ng using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR)–based TRAP assay as previously described.11  Go to: Results and discussion Figure 1A shows the pedigrees of families 199 and 284. Patient 199.1 is a 31-year-old man of Scottish descent. His clinical manifestations include short stature; elfin appearance; esophageal stricture; leukoplakia of the buccal mucosa, anus, and penis; abnormal pigmentation of his neck, trunk, and back; hyperkeratosis of his palms; ridged fingernails; avascular necrosis of both hips; tooth loss; chronic diarrhea; learning difficulties; pulmonary infiltrates; and progressive bone marrow failure (Figure 1B). His 61-year-old father was diagnosed with osteoporosis at the age of 60. His 60-year-old mother is healthy. Both parents have normal peripheral blood cell counts. The paternal grandmother (age, 84 years) has a history of anemia, osteoporosis, and pulmonary fibrosis. The maternal grandmother was reported to have died at the age of 60 years because of pulmonary fibrosis.  Figure 1 Figure 1 Pedigrees and clinical manifestations in TERT mutations (A) Pedigrees and identified TERT gene mutations in families 199 and 284. Circles, females; squares, males; white, wild type; color, mutant as indicated in the chart. Half-filled symbols indicate ... Mutation analysis revealed that patient 199.1 is homozygous for a C to T transition in exon 5 of the TERT gene (cDNA nt C2110T) causing a proline to serine substitution at amino acid 704 (P704S). Functional analysis in WI-38 VA-13 cells demonstrated that the TERT P704S mutation severely reduces telomerase activity to 13% of normal (P < .001; Figure 2A). Both parents are heterozygous for the TERT P704S mutation (Figure 1A). Interestingly, however, the father carries a second TERT mutation in exon 2. This C1234T mutation (H412Y), has been previously described in an unrelated family.3 This mutation reduced telomerase activity to 36% of normal in our transfection experiments (P < .001; Figure 2A). Coexpression of WT TERT with either the P704S or H412Y variants did not show evidence of a dominant negative effect. The coexpression of the 2 TERT mutations resulted in an intermediate telomerase activity of 22% (P < .001; Figure 2B), suggesting a synergic effect on telomerase activity and no intragenic complementation. Careful analysis of the family tree revealed that the parents are fourth cousins, explaining the presence of the TERT P704S mutation in both parents.  Figure 2 Figure 2 Telomerase activity and telomere lengths of wild-type and mutant individuals. (A) In vitro telomerase activity of the mutant TERT proteins in WI-38 VA-13 cells. WI-38 VA-13 cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing the mutant TERT cDNA sequences ... Telomere length measurement in family 199 revealed that patient 199.1 has very short telomeres (below the 1st percentile of the normal telomere length distribution; Figure 2C). Interestingly, the father (199.2), who is compound heterozygous for the TERT P704S and H412Y mutations, has also very short telomeres, whereas the mother (199.3), who is heterozygous for TERT P704S mutation, has a normal telomere length.  Patient 284.1 is an 8-year-old girl of European descent, originally diagnosed with moderate but progressive aplastic anemia. Both of her parents are healthy with no abnormalities in the peripheral blood. Family history was negative for blood diseases, pulmonary fibrosis, or cancer.  Mutation analysis revealed 2 different TERT gene sequence alterations. The A2537G in exon 9 (Y846C) and C2628G mutation in exon 10 (H876Q). Further analysis showed that the TERT Y846C mutation was inherited from the mother, whereas the TERT H876Q mutation was inherited from her father, indicating that patient 284.1 is a compound heterozygote for the 2 TERT gene mutations (Figure 1A). Both TERT gene mutations result in a significantly reduced telomerase activity after transfection into WI-38 VA-13 cells to 10% (P < .001) and 50% (P < .001) of normal (Figure 2A), whereas the cotransfection of the 2 mutants results in a telomerase activity of 38% (P = .004; Figure 2B).  Telomere length in peripheral blood cells from patient 284.1 was very short, below the 1st percentile of normal and so were those measured in her mother (284.2) and in one of her uncles (284.4), both of whom carry the TERT Y846C mutation. Telomere length in her father (284.3) heterozygous for the TERT H876Q mutation was between the 1st and 5th percentile of normal (Figure 2C).  In conclusion, we have identified 3 novel and 1 recurrent TERT gene mutation in 2 families who were thought to have sporadic DC and idiopathic aplastic anemia. All 4 mutations are hypomorphic mutations, impairing, but not eliminating telomerase activity. Homozygous hypomorphic TERT mutations have recently been found to cause disease in 2 consanguineous families.12 Here we demonstrate that in a nonconsanguineous family compound heterozygosity for TERT can cause disease and that the involvement of TERT in the pathogenesis of DC is probably more complex than initially anticipated. Our data indicate that in compound heterozygosity or homozygosity for hypomorphic TERT mutations the mutant alleles are codominant and suggest that severity of telomerase dysfunction and the inheritance of short telomeres determine the clinical phenotype and onset of disease. Codominant inheritance has also been found in one family with 2 hypomorphic TERC gene mutations,13 whereas compound heterozygosity or homozygosity for TERC or TERT null mutations have never been reported, suggesting that in humans, in contrast to mice, biallelic TERC or TERT null mutations are probably not compatible with life. The consideration that both sides of the family may be affected even in nonconsanguineous families might have important implications for the patient in the selection of a potential sibling donor as well as for the prognosis and management of other family members carrying one or 2 of the identified gene mutations.
28||Sequencing studies have identified many recurrent coding mutations in human cancer genes; however, highly recurrent mutations involving regulatory regions have rarely been observed. Here we describe two independent mutations within the TERT core promoter that, when taken together, were observed in 71% (50 of 70) of melanomas and generate de novo consensus ETS binding motifs. Reporter assays showed that these mutations increase transcriptional activity from the TERT promoter by 2–4-fold. Examination of cancer cell lines derived from diverse tumor types revealed the same mutations in 16% (24 of 150) of cases, with preliminary evidence of elevated frequency in bladder and hepatocellular cancer cells. Thus, somatic mutations in regulatory regions of the genome may represent an important tumorigenic mechanism.  Systematic characterization of human cancer genomes has led to the discovery of a wide range of mutated genes that contribute to tumor development and progression. Most of the somatic mutations in tumors reside within the protein-coding regions of genes or at splice junctions. To determine whether tumor genomes harbor recurrent mutations outside of protein-coding regions, we systematically queried noncoding somatic mutations using published whole-genome sequencing data.  Analysis of whole-genome sequencing data from malignant melanomas (1, 2) revealed two somatic telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene promoter mutations in 17 of 19 (89%) cases examined. The average sequence coverage at the TERT promoter locus was 30-fold in normal samples and 60-fold in tumor samples (fig. S1A). Each of these promoter mutations resulted in a cytidine-to-thymidine transition at a dipyrimidine motif indicative of ultraviolet (UV) light–induced damage (chr5, 1,295,228 C>T and 1,295,250 C>T; hereafter termed C228T and C250T, respectively), and both mutations localized within 100 base pairs (bp) of the TERT transcriptional start site (TSS) (mean allelic fraction, 0.32; range, 0.07 to 0.55) (table S1). We validated these mutations by means of polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing tumor/normal sample pairs from both the discovery set (Fig. 1A and fig. S1, B and C) and an extension set of 51 additional melanoma tumor/normal sample pairs. Within this extension set, 33 tumors (65%) harbored one of the mutations. Moreover, the mutations were mutually exclusive in both the discovery and extension sets (P = 5.4 × 10−7, Fisher’s one-sided exact test). Two tumors with a C228T transition also contained an adjacent C>T transition (at position chr5, 1,295,229), which is indicative of a dinucleotide CC>TT transition. Together, these TERT promoter mutations were observed in 50 of 70 (71%; 95% confidence interval: 59 to 82%, Clopper-Pearson method) melanomas examined (Fig. 1B and table S1).  Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Identification of TERT promoter mutations in melanoma and cancer cell lines Both C228T and C250T generated an identical 11-bp nucleotide stretch (5′-CCCCTTCCGGG-3′) containing a consensus binding site for E-twenty-six (ETS) transcription factors (GGAA, reverse complement) within the TERT promoter region. Because ETS transcription factors may become activated through dysregulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) signaling, we hypothesized that these promoter mutations might augment gene expression. To test this hypothesis, we used a reporter assay system in which the relevant portion of the mutant or wild-type TERT core promoter was cloned upstream of the firefly luciferase gene (2). Here, we tested both a core promoter fragment (−132 to +5 relative to the TSS) and the full core promoter (−200 to +73). In comparison to the wild-type TERT promoter, both mutations conferred approximately two- to fourfold increased transcriptional activity in five distinct cell line contexts (Fig. 1C and fig. S1D). Thus, each mutation was capable of augmenting transcriptional activity from the TERT promoter.  To investigate whether similar TERT promoter mutations occur in other cancer types, we examined sequencing data from this locus in 150 cell lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) (3). Overall, 24 CCLE lines (16%) contained either C228T or C250T (mean allelic fraction, 0.61; range, 0.17 to 1.00) (table S1). An increased frequency in melanoma was again noted (five of six lines tested), with additional evidence suggesting possible heightened prevalence (>25%; one-sided 95% confidence interval) in bladder (three of three lines) and hepatocellular cancer cell lines (four of six lines) (Fig. 1D).  Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that these promoter mutations may function as driver events that contribute to oncogenesis through TERT dysregulation and undergo positive selection, at least in human melanoma. First, the TERT promoter mutations showed a combined frequency that exceeded those of BRAF and NRAS mutations, which activate known melanoma driver oncogenes (4, 5). In an analysis restricted to somatic mutations present at an allelic fraction of 0.2 or greater [to reduce artifacts of mutation calling (1)], the four most recurrent melanoma nucleotide substitutions included BRAF [chr7, 140,453,136 A>T (V600E)], NRAS [chr1, 115,256,529 T>C (Q61R)], and the TERT core promoter mutations C228T and C250T. Second, although highly recurrent, C228T and C250T occurred in a wholly mutually exclusive fashion. This suggests the possibility that the mutations might be functionally redundant. Third, the absence of other recurrent somatic mutations in the 3 kb upstream of the TERT transcription start site in the queried melanomas (1) coupled with the absence of the described TERT promoter mutations in 24 lung adenocarcinomas with comparably high somatic mutation rates (6) reduces the possibility that these recurrent TERT promoter mutations are solely due to an increased background mutation rate at this locus. Although the role of telomerase in tumorigenesis is well established, details regarding its dysregulation in cancer cells remain incompletely understood, particularly in melanoma (7). The TERT promoter mutations identified here may link telomerase gene regulation and tumorigenic activation in this malignancy. The high prevalence of C228T and C250T suggests that these TERT promoter mutations may comprise early genetic events in the genesis of melanoma and other cancer types. Although TERT expression alone is not sufficient to bypass oncogene-induced senescence, genomic TERT activation may potentiate mechanisms by which melanocytes achieve immortalization in the setting of oncogenic mutations (8). These results therefore suggest that renewed efforts to develop clinically effective telomerase inhibitors may be warranted.  At the same time, promoter mutations likely represent only one potential mechanism of TERT reactivation in a subset of human cancers. Indeed, recurrent chromosomal copy gains spanning the TERT locus have been described previously for several cancers, including melanoma (9, 10).  Highly recurrent somatic mutations within a cancer gene promoter region have not previously been described. Similarly, the de novo mutational generation of transcription factor binding motifs in tumor genomes was heretofore unknown, although an ETS transcription factor binding motif was previously associated with a single-nucleotide polymorphism insertion at the MMP-1 locus (11). Together, these findings raise the possibility that recurrent somatic mutations involving regulatory regions, in addition to coding sequences, may represent important driver events in cancer.  TERT Promoter Mutations in Familial and Sporadic Melanoma Susanne Horn,1,2 Adina Figl,1,2 P. Sivaramakrishna Rachakonda,1 Christine Fischer,3 Antje Sucker,2 Andreas Gast,1,2 Stephanie Kadel,1,2 Iris Moll,2 Eduardo Nagore,4 Kari Hemminki,1,5 Dirk Schadendorf,2 *† Rajiv Kumar1 *† Cutaneous melanoma occurs in both familial and sporadic forms. We investigated a melanoma-prone family through linkage analysis and high-throughput sequencing and identified a disease-segregating germline mutation in the promoter of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene, which encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase. The mutation creates a new binding motif for Ets transcription factors and ternary complex factors (TCFs) near the transcription start and, in reporter gene assays, caused up to twofold increase in transcription. We then screened the TERT promoter in sporadic melanoma and observed recurrent ultraviolet signature somatic mutations in 125 of 168 (74%) of human cell lines derived from metastatic melanomas, 45 of 53 corresponding metastatic tumor tissues (85%), and 25 of 77 (33%) primary melanomas. The majority of those mutations occurred at two positions in the TERT promoter and also generated binding motifs for Ets/TCF transcription factors. The identification of germline mutations that cosegregate with disease in cancerprone families often provides genetic and mechanistic insights into the more common, sporadically arising cancers. In a study of cutaneous melanoma, the most malignant skin cancer, we investigated a large pedigree with 14 related melanoma patients who were not carriers of germline mutations in CDKN2A or CDK4, two known melanoma genes (Fig. 1). Multipoint linkage analysis showed a possible 2.2-Mb linkage region on chromosome 5p with maximal logarithm of the odds ratio for linkage scores of 2.35 at rs1379917 and 2.45 at rs1968011. Target-enriched high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of the region was carried out on constitutional DNA from the four affected and four unaffected members of the family with an average coverage between 55- and 108-fold (table S1) (1). The HTS data revealed a single promoter variant, three intronic variants, and three nongene variants previously unknown and unique to the DNA sequences of the affected individuals (table S2). The disease segregating variants, seven in total, were validated by Sanger sequencing of DNA from the individuals sequenced by HTS and of DNA from additional unaffected members of the family. The new variants were also detected in an unaffected member (754, table S3), who was 36 years old and carried multiple nevi. DNA from affected individuals other than those sequenced by HTS was not available for testing. Of the seven unique variants identified, one variant (T>G), was located in the promoter at –57 base pairs (bp) from ATG translation start site of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT ) gene. The TERT gene encodes the catalytic reverse transcriptase subunit of telomerase, the ribonucleoprotein complex that maintains telomere length. The nucleotide change in the sequence CCTGAA>CCGGAA creates a new binding motif for Ets transcription factors, with a general recognition motif GGA(A/T). Beyond the general motif for Ets transcription factors, the familial mutation also generates a binding motif, CCGGAA, for the ternary complex factors (TCFs) Elk1 and Elk4 (2, 3). To exclude the possibility that the detected promoter mutation in TERT is a common germline variant, we screened germline DNA from 140 sporadic melanoma cases and 165 healthy controls, and none carried the variant. Screening of DNA from index cases from 34 Spanish melanoma families also did not show any mutations. No carriers were found in dbSNP and the 1000 Genomes databases (data available for 18 individuals were obtained from Ensembl). The familial mutation in the TERT promoter was in complete allelic linkage with a common polymorphism rs2853669 (G>A) at –246 bp upstream from the ATG start site (table S3). In previous work, this polymorphism was reported to disrupt an Ets binding site, and it was associated with low telomerase activity in patients with non– small cell lung cancer (4). In luciferase reporter gene assays, we found that the activity of constructs containing the mutation at –57 bp of the TERT promoter was increased 1.5-fold and 1.2- fold over the wild-type construct in Ma-Mel-86a and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells, respectively. A construct with both the TERT mutation and the variant allele of the rs2853669 polymorphism showed a 2.2-fold increase in promoter activity in Ma-Mel-86a and and 1.3-fold increase in HEK293 cells (mean from three measurements; details in supplementary text and fig. S1). The germline occurrence of the promoter mutation, creating an Ets/TCF motif, can result in modification of TERT expression in all tissues expressing Ets/TCF. Highest staining for the TCF Elk1 protein has been reported in female-specific tissues, such as ovary and placenta. The increased expression of TCF Elk1 protein in female-specific tissues may cause gender-related differences in 1 Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Center, Im Neuenheimer Feld 580, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany. 2 Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Essen, 45122 Essen, Germany. 3 Institute of Human Genetics, University of Heidelberg, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany. 4 Department of Dermatology, Instituto Valenciano de Oncologia, Valencia, Spain. 5 Center for Primary Health Care Research, Lund University, Malmö, Sweden. *To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Two affected members of the family developed several different types of cancer (marked with # in Fig. 1). One affected individual presented with ovarian cancer at age 27 and melanoma at age 30. Another individual was diagnosed with melanoma at age 20; later she developed ovarian cancer, renal cell carcinoma, bladder cancer, mammary carcinoma, and finally bronchial carcinoma, leading to her death at age 50. The mutation in the melanoma-prone family prompted us to screen melanoma cell lines derived from sporadic cases of metastatic melanoma. None of the cell lines carried the mutation detected in the family. However, we identified recurrent ultraviolet (UV)–signature mutations in the TERT core promoter in 74% (125 of 168) of the cell lines. The mutations were located within a 49-bp region starting from –100 bp upstream of the ATG start site (Table 1, Fig. 2, fig. S2, and table S4). There were two frequent mutations at –124 bp (G>A; C>T on opposite strand) and –146 bp (G>A); these mutations were mutually exclusive and occurred in 27 and 38% of cell lines, respectively. Two tandem GG>AA (CC>TT) mutations at positions –124/–125 bp and –138/–139 bp were observed at a frequency of 9%. The tandem mutation at positions –138/–139 bp could also be generated by a single-base mutation at –138 bp, because the base change at –139 bp has been reported as a rare polymorphism (rs35550267). The two most frequent single-base mutations as well as the two tandem mutations also result in the creation of Ets/TCF binding motifs. Mutations were confirmed in 45 of 53 (85%) available metastasized tumors corresponding to the cell lines. The somatic nature of the mutations was shown by the absence of mutations in corresponding DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells available from 23 patients. Somatic mutations in the TERT promoter were more frequent than the BRAF mutations (53%, 90 of 169), CDKN2A alterations (50%, 84 of 169), and NRAS mutations (23%, 38 of 169; fig. S3). The occurrence of concomitant mutations in the TERT promoter and BRAF was more frequent (47%) than by random chance (40%) with an odds ratio (OR) of 3.2 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3 to 8.2]. Concomitant mutations in TERT, BRAF, and CDKN2Awere observed in 30% of cell lines compared with the expected frequency of such occurrence of 9% (OR 5.6, 95% CI 2.4 to 13.8). The high recurrence and specificity of the TERT promoter mutations, together with the preliminary evidence from reporter assays that they have a functional effect on transcription, suggest that these mutations are driver rather than passenger events. Extensive functional studies will be required to validate this hypothesis. The TERT promoter mutations were also detected in 25 out of 77 (33%) paraffin embedded primary melanoma tumors (Table 1 and table S5) at –124 bp (7/77; 9%) and –146 bp (5/77; 7%). Four primary tumors carried the GG>AA tandem mutations at –124/–125 bp, and eight primary tumors carried the GG>AA tandem mutations at –138/–139 bp. Reduced sensitivity to detect mutations in paraffin-embedded primary tumors because of contaminating normal cells cannot be ruled out. Primary tumors harbored five additional mutations in the TERT promoter, which were not present in metastases, and those did not generate Ets/TCF binding motifs. We also screened DNA extracted from 25 melanocytic nevi and only one carried a mutation at –101 bp, which did not create an Ets/TCF motif. For both primary tumors and melanocytic nevi, matched normal control DNA was not available for testing. The TERT coding region has been reported to be somatically mutated in 1% of cancers (14 cancer types, 1271 unique samples) (6). Mutations creating Ets/TCF binding motifs in the TERT promoter in melanoma have not been described in earlier sequencing projects. TCFs are a subfamily of Ets transcription factors; two members of this subfamily, Elk1 and Elk4, are downstream targets of BRAF and regulate the expression of many genes (7–11). Conceivably, TCF may represent a link between telomerase activity and the frequent BRAF activating mutations in melanoma (fig. S4) (12, 13). Lastly, whether TERT promoter mutations occur in other cancer types remains to be determined. We did not detect these mutations in a screen of 22 esophageal squamous cell c  Reactivation of telomerase has been implicated in human tumorigenesis, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we report the presence of recurrent somatic mutations in the TERT promoter in cancers of the central nervous system (43%), bladder (59%), thyroid (follicular cell-derived, 10%) and skin (melanoma, 29%). In thyroid cancers, the presence of TERT promoter mutations (when occurring together with BRAF mutations) is significantly associated with higher TERT mRNA expression, and in glioblastoma we find a trend for increased telomerase expression in cases harbouring TERT promoter mutations. Both in thyroid cancers and glioblastoma, TERT promoter mutations are significantly associated with older age of the patients. Our results show that TERT promoter mutations are relatively frequent in specific types of human cancers, where they lead to enhanced expression of telomerase.

Reactivation or re-expression of telomerase is referred to be a widespread feature in human cancers, although the genetic basis remains poorly understood in many cancer types. Somatic mutations in the coding region of TERT (human telomerase reverse transcriptase) are infrequent in human tumours, but germline and somatic mutations in TERT promoter were recently found in a high percentage of human melanomas and human cancer cell lines1,2. Such mutations occurred in two hotspot positions, located  124 and  146 bp upstream from the ATG start site (  124 G4A and  146 G4A, C4T on opposite strand) and conferred enhanced TERT promoter activity1,2, by putatively generating a consensus binding site (GGAA) for ETS transcription factors within the TERT promoter region1,2. Our aim was to investigate whether the aforementioned TERT promoter mutations were present in cancer types other than melanoma, having for that matter screened 741 primary tumours from the thyroid, kidney, bladder, gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST), adrenal medulla (phaeochromocytomas) and central nervous system (CNS). Besides skin melanoma, we have also included ocular melanoma (not studied in the previous reports), benign lesions of the thyroid and skin and 58 human cancer-derived cell lines. Our results highlight TERT promoter mutations as frequent events in specific types of human cancers. Results TERT mutations in tumours and cell lines. Overall, TERT promoter mutations were found in 142 (19%) human tumour samples (Table 1; Fig. 1a) and 14 (24%) human cell lines (Fig. 1b; Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). The  124-bp mutation was the most frequent, being present in 99 cases, whereas the  146- bp mutation was present in 43 cases. The  124 G4A and  146 G4A mutations were found in a mutually exclusive fashion. Two tandem GG4AA mutations at positions  124/  125 and  138/  139 bp were observed in one cell line each (Supplementary Fig. S1 and Supplementary Table S1). TERT promoter mutations were not detected in normal thyroid tissue nor in benign lesions (nevi, thyroiditis, goitres and adenomas). No mutations were detected in 26 kidney cancers, 17 phaeochromocytomas and 36 GISTs. TERT mutations in melanoma. We have analysed both skin and ocular melanomas, a type of melanoma that was not previously studied1,2. TERT mutations were present in 16 out of 56 (29%) skin melanomas, but absent in the 25 ocular melanomas (Table 1). All the four skin melanoma-derived cell lines but none of the six ocular melanoma-derived cell lines harboured TERT mutations (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table S1). Ten out of 16 (63%) skin melanomas with TERT mutation also harboured the BRAFV600E mutation, whereas the BRAF mutation was present in 9 out of 38 (24%) melanomas without TERT mutation (P ¼ 0.01, Fisher’s exact test, two-sided) (Supplementary Fig. S2 and Supplementary Table S3). TERT mutations in CNS tumours. In CNS tumours, TERT promoter mutations were found in 43% (51/118) of all cases with an equal prevalence of both mutations (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S4). The frequency of TERT mutations was different according to the tumour histology and grade (Fig. 1c): although pilocytic astrocytomas (World Health Organization (WHO) grade 1) and diffuse astrocytoma (WHO grade 2) showed a lower frequency of mutations (8% and 15%, respectively), the most aggressive form, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; WHO grade 4), present the highest frequency of TERT mutations (62%). Oligodendrogliomas (WHO grade 2) and anaplastic oligodendrogliomas (WHO grade 3) also harboured a high frequency of TERT mutations (45% and 54%, respectively). The presence of TERT mutations was significantly associated with a higher mean age at diagnosis (Supplementary Table S5) in CNS patients as a whole (Po0.0001; Mann–Whitney test, twotailed) and also in GBM patients only (P ¼ 0.0247; Mann– Whitney test, two-tailed); in oligodendroglioma patients, we found the same trend, although not statistically significant (P ¼ 0.0709; Mann–Whitney test, two-tailed). In addition, we observed that, in a subset of 14 GBM (8 TERT wild-type tumours and 6 TERT-mutated tumours), the tumours with TERT mutations showed a trend to increased immunohistochemistry (IHC) expression of telomerase, although this difference was not statistically significant (P ¼ 0.4250; Mann–Whitney test, two-tailed) (Fig. 2). TERT mutations in thyroid cancer. We analysed a large series of follicular cell-derived thyroid samples including normal thyroid (n ¼ 27), benign (n ¼ 81) and malignant lesions (n ¼ 263) (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S6). TERT mutations were only detected in malignant tumours (10%) (Fig. 1d), namely in Table 1 | Prevalence of TERT promoter recurrent mutations in human cancers.

Within the group of PTC, TERT mutations were detected to be associated to the so-called conventional PTC (cPTC) (11%).The majority of TERT-mutated thyroid cancers harboured the  124 G4A mutation (22 out of 27 cases) (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Table S7). In thyroid cancer patients, TERT mutations were significantly associated with guarded prognosis features such as larger tumours (P ¼ 0.008; Mann–Whitney test, two-tailed), older patients (Po0.0001; Mann–Whitney test, two-tailed) and male gender (P ¼ 0.0312; Fisher’s exact test, two-sided) (Supplementary Table S5). After histotype stratification, such correlations were only kept in the group of cPTC where we also found significant associations with lymph node metastasis (P ¼ 0.0318; Fisher’s exact test, two-sided) and BRAFV600E mutation (P ¼ 0.001; Fisher’s exact test, two-sided) (Supplementary Fig. S2 and Supplementary Table S8).

In bladder cancer, TERT mutations were frequently detected (48/82; 59%) both in lowgrade tumours (14/21; 67%) and high-grade tumours (34/61; 56%) (Table 1 and Fig. 1e; Supplementary Table S9). The  124 G4A mutation was present in 30 cases, whereas the  146 G4A was found in 18 cases. No association was found between the presence of the mutation and the age of the patients. No mutations were detected in 26 kidney cancers, 17 phaeochromocytoma and 36 GISTs (Supplementary Tables S10, S11 and S12, respectively). Discussion Recent findings have described that TERT promoter mutations arise as a novel mechanism of telomerase reactivation/expression in human cancers1,2. In this work, we report for the first time the presence of these mutations in different histotypes of thyroid cancer, and our results validate the findings reported by others in melanoma, bladder and gliomas1–3. Furthermore, we present for the first time evidence showing that TERT promoter mutations are significantly associated with increased TERT mRNA expression in thyroid cancers. We also found a trend for increased telomerase expression in cases of GBM harbouring TERT promoter mutations. In thyroid cancers, TERT mRNA was particularly high in cases harbouring both TERT and BRAF mutations. The location of these mutations in the TERT promoter, rather than the coding region of the gene, creating additional binding sites for transcription factors, represents also a novel mechanism of genetic activation in cancer. The frequency of TERT mutations we detected in skin melanomas is similar to that reported by Horn et al.1 in primary melanomas (33%), but lower than the frequency found by the same authors in metastatic melanomas (85%) and by Huang et al.2 in a series of 70 melanomas and short-term cultures1,2. In our series, we have analysed few metastatic melanomas that did not show a significantly higher percentage of TERT mutations. As our series is too small to allow a conclusion, it remains to be verified if there is an increased frequency of TERT mutations in metastatic melanomas, as suggested by previous reports1,2. We have confirmed, in skin melanomas, the significant association between TERT and BRAF mutations, as previously advanced by Horn et al.1, which we now also demonstrate in thyroid cancers. Interestingly, in benign nevi, which frequently harbour BRAF mutations, we did not detect TERT mutations. This finding, together with the high frequency of TERT mutations in metastatic melanomas1, suggests that, although BRAF mutations are thought to be an early event in melanoma genesis, TERT mutations may occur at a later stage. No TERT promoter mutations were found in ocular melanomas, which, at variance with skin melanomas, harbour GNAQ mutations instead of BRAF mutations4,5. Our results further support the assumption that ocular melanomas result from different etiopathogenic mechanism than skin melanomas5,6. Our data on CNS tumours indicate that TERT promoter mutations are frequent events in gliomas, particularly in GBM where the highest mutation frequency was found. It has been shown that TERT mutations conferred enhanced TERT promoter activity in vitro1,2; our findings fit with this assumption because we observed that GBM with TERT promoter mutations appear to display increased telomerase expression, despite the limited sensitivity of IHC and the low number of cases analysed. Our results are also in concordance with those of Lotsch et al.7 who reported that 60% of GBMs were positive for TERT mRNA and telomerase activity7. It will be interesting to assess whether the GBM positive for telomerase activity described by Lotsch et al.7 also harbour TERT promoter mutations. Our findings also indicate that TERT mutations are associated with older patients, in accordance with a recent report3. The high frequency of TERT mutations in CNS tumours, particularly in intermediate and high-grade tumours, opens a window for new approaches in the therapy of CNS tumours. In thyroid cancer, TERT mutations were only found in follicular cell-derived cancers (PTC, follicular thyroid carcinoma, poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma). No mutations were detected in medullary thyroid carcinomas, as described by Killela et al.3, nor in normal thyroid and benign lesions, such as goitre, adenomas or thyroiditis; this finding fits with previous studies that reported telomerase expression in malignant lesions and not in normal tissue or hyperplastic lesions8,9.

In cPTC, TERT mutations were associated with BRAF mutation, highlighting the coexistence of activation of BRAF and TERT, previously reported in melanoma1 (Supplementary Fig. S2). Our results reinforce the hypothesis of a link between BRAF activation and telomerase expression, which can be mediated by transcription factors binding to the newly created consensus binding sites, as previously advanced by Horn et al.1. Both in thyroid carcinoma and melanoma, it seems that a ‘background’ status of activated BRAF enhances the effects of TERT promoter mutation. Our results in TERT mRNA expression strengthen this assumption, showing, for the first time, an increased TERT expression in tumours harbouring BRAF and TERT mutation (Fig. 3). Further observational and mechanistic studies are needed to clarify these points. TERT alterations seem to constitute an early and frequent event in bladder cancer. These findings fit with the high prevalence of telomerase activity previously described in bladder tumours10. The recurrent hotspot mutations in TERT were advanced to be, in melanomas, induced by ultraviolet radiation2. Bladder is a target for several chemical carcinogens; it remains to be found whether TERT mutations can also result from the action of such agents. The identification of TERT mutations in urine may provide a biomarker for early diagnosis and monitoring of bladder cancer. No TERT mutations were detected in kidney cancers, nor in 17 phaeochromocytoma and 36 GISTs. The underlying reasons for the tissue specificity of TERT mutations remain to be clarified. We can hypothesize that TERT mutations can be present in two settings. As described by Killela et al.3, TERT mutations can be relevant in tissues with relative low rates of self-renewal, which fits with our findings in follicular cell-derived thyroid cancer and gliomas where they are associated with the older age of the patients. On the other hand, these mutations can also result from environmental factors such as ultraviolet radiation and chemical carcinogens as suggested by their high frequency in melanoma, bladder and tongue1–3. In summary, our data identify TERT mutations as common events in human cancers and support the assumption that TERT promoter mutations may be one of the mechanisms that underlies telomerase reactivation in several types of human tumours.  Introduction The telomere sequences at the chromosomal ends, composed of tandem repeats of TTAGGG, are protected by a number of molecules that constitute the capping Shelterin complex [1 ;  2]. The incomplete replication due to limitations of the process, called ‘end-replication problem’, results in shortening of telomeres in each successive mitotic cell division that eventually leads to replicative senescence referred to as the ‘Hayflick limit’ [3; 4 ;  5]. Maintenance of telomere repeat length is dependent on sustained expression of telomerase holoenzyme that adds de novo repeat units at the end of each replication cycle [ 6 ;  7]. Progressive attrition of telomeres is also defined as one of the hallmarks of aging of organisms [ 8 ;  9]. Cancer cells, characteristically, acquire infinite capability to divide through maintenance of telomeres by sustained expression of telomerase or in its absence by an alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) mechanism [ 10; 11; 12; 13; 14 ;  15••].  Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase that together with a RNA component, TERC, maintains genomic integrity by telomere elongation [ 16]. Though TERT and TERC are sufficient for in vitro telomerase activity, the in vivo telomerase functioning requires additional components that associate with TERT and TERC, to form the holoenzyme [ 17 ;  18]. Those include dyskerin (DKC), NOP10 ribonucleoprotein (NOP10), GAR1 ribonucleoprotein homolog (yeast) (GAR1), NHP2 ribonucleoprotein (NHP2), reptin and pontin [ 11; 19; 20; 21 ;  22].  Deregulation of telomerase has been shown to be a ubiquitous feature in human cancers with over 90% of cancers showing an upregulation of the enzyme [11; 23 ;  24]. The telomerase activity is dependent on a number of factors, regulated at various stages, which include gene transcription, mRNA splicing, maturation and modifications of TERT and TERC, transport and localization of those components and assembly of active telomerase ribonucleoprotein to telomeres [ 4; 5; 16; 20; 21; 25; 26 ;  27]. The catalytic component TERT acts as a determinant of telomerase activity and its transcription is repressed in most of the somatic cells with the exception of proliferative cells of self-renewing tissues [ 28; 29 ;  30]. An increased expression of TERT has been consistently demonstrated to be a fundamental requirement for cellular transformation [ 4; 31; 32; 33; 34• ;  35].  The mechanism of TERT upregulation in cancers had been attributed to several mechanisms including epigenetic deregulation as well as genetic amplification of the locus containing TERT gene [ 36 ;  37]. In the absence of any evidence of a definite mechanism, the telomerase activity in tumor cells has been attributed to the assumption of stem cells being the progenitors in all cancers [38]. The normal stem cells in self-renewing tissues retain telomerase throughout lifetime replication thus abrogating a requirement for a positive selection [6]. The recently discovered TERT promoter mutations add a new dimension to the acquisition of telomerase activity in human cancers. In this review we provide an overview and possible implications of the newly discovered mutations in the promoter of the TERT gene in a wide range of cancers.  Structure and regulation of the TERT promoter The human TERT gene is located on chromosome 5p15.33 and the promoter region of the gene is considered to be the most important regulatory element for telomerase expression. The TERT promoter contains binding motifs for several factors that regulate the gene transcription and distinctly lacks a TATA box or a similar sequence [ 39; 40; 41; 42 ;  43]. The core promoter region consists of 260 base pairs with several transcription-factor binding sites that include E-boxes where c-Myc has been confirmed to bind and activate the transcription [ 44; 45; 46; 47 ;  48]. BRCA1 in conjunction with N-Myc interacting protein (Nmi) forms a complex with c-Myc and inhibits TERT promoter activity, that property is lost in some mutant forms of BRCA1 [ 49]. Other sequence elements in TERT promoter include GC-boxes, which are binding sites for zinc finger transcription factor, Sp1 [ 4 ;  45]. Transcription of the TERT gene is also regulated by various hormones, cytokines and oncogenes [ 45]. Several repressors of the TERT transcription are also known. p53 has been shown to downregulate TERT transcription in a Sp1-dependent manner [ 50]. Ets transcription factors that comprise over 30 members are prominently associated with telomerase activation [ 42 ;  51]. Ets2 has been shown to form a complex with c-Myc in a breast cancer cell line [ 44 ;  51]. Ets transcription factors are also shown to be stimulated by oncogenes EGF, Her2/Nez, Ras and Raf [ 52 ;  53]. The activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressors are known to account for cellular immortalization through induction of TERT transcription [ 54]. The high GC content around the transcription start site of the TERT promoter confers epigenetic regulation through methylation and chromatin remodeling [ 37 ;  55].  TERT promoter mutations in human cancers A discovery of a high-penetrant disease-segregating causal germline mutation in a melanoma family and highly specific and recurrent somatic mutations in tumors from unrelated patients in the TERT promoter has likely provided a definite mechanism for cancer-specific TERT activation [ 56•• ;  57••]. Two independent studies using diverse approaches discovered non-coding mutations, mainly at two residues, within the core promoter region of the TERT gene. One study was based on the identification of a causal gene mutation in a large melanoma pedigree where affected individuals presented a severe form of the disease with an early age of onset. The linkage analysis identified a 2.2 megabase telomeric region on chromosome 5p that included TERT along with more than 80 other genes [ 56••]. Sequencing of the entire stretch of DNA region in the family resulted in identification of a disease segregating A > C (T > G) single base change at −57 bp (Chr 5: 1,295,161 hg19 coordinate) from ATG start site. The germline mutation was present in affected and absent in unaffected individuals in the family with the exception of one. Subsequent screening of cell lines derived from melanoma metastases from unrelated patients led to the detection of recurrent and mutually exclusive somatic mutations at two residues −124 and −146 from the ATG start site in the TERT promoter [ 56••]. Serendipitously, an independent study using a whole genome sequencing approach also reported the recurrent somatic TERT promoter mutations at the same positions [ 57••]. Other mutations detected in TERT promoter included the CC > TT tandem mutations at −124/−125 and −138/−139 bp from ATG start site. The germline and somatic mutations in the non-coding part of the TERT gene were defined by common salient features. One of the underlying features included a de novo creation of CCGGAA/T general binding motifs for E-twenty six/ternary complex factors (Ets/TCF) transcription factors, which differed from pre-existing GGAA/T Ets binding sites within the TERT promoter ( Figure 1). The somatic mutations at both positions being C > T and the additional detection of CC > TT tandem mutations in a proportion of tumors augmented the evidence for the UV-origin of tumor specific nucleotide changes in melanoma as shown previously in studies based on whole genome sequencing [58•]. Interestingly, the mutations detected in the TERT promoter in melanoma were more frequent than those in the BRAF gene.  Schematic representation of a part of the TERT promoter that contains residues, ... Figure 1.  Schematic representation of a part of the TERT promoter that contains residues, which are affected by a germline mutation in a melanoma family at the position −57 bp and recurrent somatic mutations at the positions −124 and −146 bp from the ATG start site. The mutations create CCGGAA/T binding motif for Ets/TCF transcription factors that results in an increased TERT expression. Pre-existing binding sites for other transcriptions factors are shown above the sequence. Figure options It was also observed that the TERT promoter mutations tend to occur more often than expected by chance in tumors with either BRAF mutations (odds ratio [OR] 3.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3–8.2) or with concomitant alterations in both BRAF and CDKN2A (OR 5.6, 95% CI 2.4–13.8) [ 56••]. BRAF mutations, due to occurrence and role in development of melanocytic nevi, are considered as the driver genetic lesions in melanoma [ 56••; 59• ;  60]. The loss of CDKN2A has been suggested to play a role in the escape of melanocytes from BRAF induced senescence [61]. The acquisition of TERT promoter mutations can be hypothesized to facilitate stabilization of the transformed genome through reversal of telomeric loss. Most melanocytic nevi carry BRAF mutations, whereas TERT promoter mutations and CDKN2A alterations are detected only in primary melanoma and beyond [ 56•• ;  62].  Bonafide of newly discovered non-coding mutations in the TERT promoter was established by the detection in cancers other than melanoma [ 63••]. The frequency of the mutations seems to vary between cancer types (Table 1). The highest frequencies of the TERT promoter mutations have so far been reported, besides melanoma, in pleomorphic dermal sarcoma, myxoid liposarcoma, glioma, urothelial cell carcinoma of bladder, basal and squamous cell carcinoma of skin, liver cancer and others [ 63••; 64; 65; 66; 67; 68; 69; 70; 71; 72; 73; 74; 75 ;  76]. The mutations occur in other cancer types as well, albeit, at low frequencies [ 63•• ;  67]. Based on the prevalence in different cancer types it has been hypothesized that the TERT promoter mutations mainly occur in tumors that are derived from tissues with low rates of self-renewal [ 63•• ;  77]. Unlike melanoma and other skin related malignancies, no tumor from the cancers affecting internal organs carried CC > TT tandem mutations in the TERT promoter with the exception of that at the positions −138/−139 bp from ATG start site in bladder cancer. The tandem mutation reported so far in 4 of the 1231 bladder tumors could also be generated by a single-base mutation at −138 bp as the base change at −139 bp has been reported as a rare polymorphism represented by rs35550267 [ 56••; 65 ;  66]. The differences in mutational pattern in cancer types are known to reflect etiological divergences and the C > T base change in tumors can also be attributed to APOBEC cytidine deaminase expression in cancer development [ 78•• ;  79••].

Table options Functional aspects of TERT promoter mutations The high recurrence, specificity and gain of function support that the non-coding TERT promoter mutations are driver rather than passenger events in cancer development. The functional relevance of the mutations was indicated by the basic reporter assays that showed 2–4-fold increased promoter activity [ 56••; 57•• ;  80••]. Tumors from thyroid cancers, primary glioma, malignant pleural mesothelioma and liver cancers with TERT promoter mutations were associated with higher gene expression than those without mutations [ 67; 69; 72 ;  74]. Though limited at the moment, the available data do indicate a tendency of the TERT promoter mutations being present in specific clinical and phenotypic subtypes and appear to be associated with adversarial forms of the disease. While in medulloblastomas the TERT promoter mutations were inversely associated with increased OTX2 expression; in primary adult glioma, the mutations occurred mainly in conjunction with EGFR amplification [ 69]. Glioma patients with TERT promoter mutations showed an association with poorer survival than patients without mutations; in thyroid cancer, mutations are reportedly more frequent in advanced thyroid cancers than in papillary thyroid cancers [ 63••; 70 ;  71].  The studies on bladder cancer consistently showed that TERT promoter mutations are the most frequent lesions with even distribution across all stages and grades [ 65; 66 ;  80••]. Intriguingly, an observed interaction has raised a possibility of eventual use of the TERT promoter mutations in conjunction with a common polymorphism within the sequence as biomarkers in bladder cancer. The data from bladder cancer showed that the variant allele of a common polymorphism at −245 bp from ATG start site in the TERT promoter acts as a modifier of the effect of TERT promoter mutations on patient survival and disease recurrence [ 80••]. Bladder cancer patients with TERT promoter mutations in tumors showed almost two-fold decreased survival and increased disease recurrence in the absence but not in the presence of the variant allele for the rs2853669 polymorphism [ 80••]. Mechanistic support for the observation was provided by the fact that mutations result in de novo creation of Ets/TCF binding motifs; the variant allele of the rs2853669 polymorphism, on the contrary, disrupts a preexisting non-canonical Ets2 binding site in the proximal region of the TERT promoter, adjacent to an E-box [ 44].  The occurrence of highly specific TERT promoter mutations indicates a strong selection pressure for the gene over-expression on path to cellular transformation. Increased telomerase production has been demonstrated to promote cancer progression in an animal model [ 81•]. The effect of the promoter mutations on TERT expression can be tenable only in the presence of Ets/TCF transcription factors that can specifically bind to the de novo sites created by the mutations. Some of the Ets/TCF transcription factors are downstream targets of MAPK pathway, where BRAF is a prominent intermediate [ 82; 83 ;  84]. Whether in melanoma activated BRAF is a driving force in selection of TERT promoter mutations remains to be determined. Nevertheless, expression of Ets transcription factors is ubiquitous in melanoma and other cancers [ 85 ;  86].  Many studies have stressed the function of the TERT gene beyond its role in maintenance of the telomere; therefore the mutations in the TERT promoter can affect non-canonical processes associated with TERT [ 87; 88; 89; 90 ;  91]. TERT acts as a modulator of Wnt-b-catenin signaling pathway and induces stem cell characteristics in glioma; TERT also regulates expression of NF-kB, a master regulator of inflammation [ 92•; 93 ;  94]. TERT was shown to be important for proliferation of p53-negative cells through ATR mediated stabilization of ETV1, which binds downstream of the transcriptional start site [95]. Other non-canonical functions of TERT include enhanced cell proliferation, decreased apoptosis, regulation of DNA damage responses, chromatin state and increased cellular proliferation life span [ 96; 97 ;  98]. The effect of the mutations beyond transcription also remains a probability. The human TERT promoter contains G-rich sequence and has potential for G-quadruplex formation that can potentially be targeted to regulate gene transcription [ 99]. G-quadruplexes have been also implicated in inhibition of telomerase and control of gene expression [100].  Conceptual advancement and therapeutic possibilities The TERT promoter mutations are thought to represent a conceptual advancement in the sense that those instead of altering an encoded protein modulate transcriptional regulation and represent first evidence of driver alterations in so called ‘dark matter’ of the human genome [ 101• ;  102]. A host of germline variants discovered through genome wide association studies contribute to the susceptibility of various diseases through transcriptional deregulation [103]. While TERT promoter mutations represent novel findings in human cancer, alterations in components associated with telomerase assembly, telomere protection or telomere recruitment are known to impact stem cell function and lifespan in mammals through various disorders [ 104 ;  105].  Several strategies of therapeutic telomerase inhibition including small molecular inhibitors, immunotherapy, gene therapy, telomere and telomerase-proteins in different cancers have entered clinical trial [106]. It will be interesting to see if the TERT promoter mutations, that increase gene expression, influence the current on-going research on targeted therapeutics or if the use of telomerase inhibitors in conjunction with kinase inhibitors like vemurafenib or similar small molecules in melanoma can alleviate recurrent resistance [ 107]. Malignant cells, like all actively growing cells, must maintain their telomeres, but genetic mechanisms responsible for telomere maintenance in tumors have only recently been discovered. In particular, mutations of the telomere binding proteins alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX) or death-domain associated protein (DAXX) have been shown to underlie a telomere maintenance mechanism not involving telomerase (alternative lengthening of telomeres), and point mutations in the promoter of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene increase telomerase expression and have been shown to occur in melanomas and a small number of other tumors. To further define the tumor types in which this latter mechanism plays a role, we surveyed 1,230 tumors of 60 different types. We found that tumors could be divided into types with low (<15%) and high (≥15%) frequencies of TERT promoter mutations. The nine TERT-high tumor types almost always originated in tissues with relatively low rates of self renewal, including melanomas, liposarcomas, hepatocellular carcinomas, urothelial carcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas of the tongue, medulloblastomas, and subtypes of gliomas (including 83% of primary glioblastoma, the most common brain tumor type). TERT and ATRX mutations were mutually exclusive, suggesting that these two genetic mechanisms confer equivalent selective growth advantages. In addition to their implications for understanding the relationship between telomeres and tumorigenesis, TERT mutations provide a biomarker that may be useful for the early detection of urinary tract and liver tumors and aid in the classification and prognostication of brain tumors.  Telomeres are nucleoprotein complexes at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes that are required for chromosomal integrity. Several hundred nucleotides of telomere repeats cap each chromosomal end, and in the absence of telomerase activity, telomeres shorten with each cell division (1). Eventually, uncapped telomeres trigger cell death or senescence. Cancer cells seem to divide ad infinitum and therefore, require some telomere maintenance mechanism to avoid this fate. Because telomerase activity is generally higher in cancer cells than normal cells, it was originally believed that telomerase was somehow activated in cancer cells (2–6). However, it was subsequently realized that telomerase was only inactive in terminally differentiated cells and that normal stem cells in self-renewing tissues retained telomerase activity (1, 7–9). Because normal stem cells must replicate throughout the long lifetimes of mammals (which can be more than a century in humans), it is clear that such cells must also retain telomerase activity. Because normal stem cells are thought to be the progenitors of cancers, there would be no need to specifically activate telomerase in cancer cells; the enzyme was already active in the precursors, just as were the hundreds of other enzymes and proteins normally required for cell proliferation.  This view was challenged by the discovery of another mechanism for maintaining telomere length [i.e., alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT)] (10–12). ALT occurs in the absence of telomerase activity and seems to be dependent on homologous recombination. It occurs in a particularly high fraction of certain tumor types, such as sarcomas, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, and brain tumors, but rarely in most common tumor types, such as those tumor types of the colon, breast, lung, prostate, or pancreas (13). Why would cancer cells need ALT if telomerase activity was already constitutively active in their precursors? This question was highlighted by the discovery that many ALT cancers harbor mutations in alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX) or death-domain associated protein (DAXX), genes encoding proteins that interact with each other at telomeres (10, 11). Presumably, the absence of functional ATRX/DAXX complexes permits the homologous recombination resulting in ALT. At minimum, these data were compatible with the ideas that there could be a selective advantage for genetic alterations that results in telomere maintenance and that telomerase is not indefinitely activated in all normal stem cell precursors of cancers.  Another challenge to the idea that genetic alterations were not required for telomerase activation in cancer was raised by the finding that mutations of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter occurred in ∼70% of melanomas and in a small number of tumor cell lines derived from various tissue types (14, 15). Importantly, only 5 of 110 cell lines derived from lung, stomach, ovary, uterus, or prostate cancers harbored TERT promoter mutations, whereas 19 mutations were found among 37 cell lines derived from various other tumor types. This situation is analogous to the situation for ALT, which is infrequently observed in common epithelial cancers but is observed more regularly in tumors derived from nonepithelial cells, particularly sarcomas and brain tumors (13).  These findings prompted us to formulate a hypothesis about the mechanisms responsible for telomerase activity in cancers. We suggest that there are two ways to maintain telomere lengths as cells divide: (i) through epigenetic regulation of telomerase activity, which occurs in stem cells of tissues that are rapidly renewing, and (ii) through somatic mutations that maintain telomere lengths, such as mutations in the TERT promoter or mutations in DAXX or ATRX. Those cancers that originate in tissues that are constantly self-renewing, such as cancers of the epithelia of the gastrointestinal tract and skin or bone marrow, would be unlikely to harbor telomere-maintaining mutations, because telomerase is already epigenetically activated in their precursor cells. In contrast, tumors arising from cells that are not constantly self-renewing, such as neurons, glial cells, fibroblasts, hepatocytes, islet cells, and pancreatic ductal epithelial cells, might frequently harbor such mutations. A corollary of this hypothesis is that tumor types exhibiting high frequencies of ALT would also exhibit high frequencies of TERT mutations, and these mutations would be distributed in a mutually exclusive fashion. To test these hypotheses as well as answer other questions related to the role of TERT promoter mutations in various cancer types, we determined the prevalence of TERT promoter mutations in a large number of tumors.  Go to: RESULTS We attempted to evaluate at least 20 individual specimens of common tumor types and fewer specimens of rare tumor types, depending on availability of specimens in our laboratories. In those tumor types in which our pilot studies showed a significant number of mutations, additional tumors were evaluated. Melanomas and tumors of the lung, stomach, and esophagus were excluded, because they had already been adequately evaluated in the seminal papers cited (14, 15). When primary tumors rather than cell lines were used, we ensured that the fraction of neoplastic cells was >50% through histopathologic examination of frozen sections of the tissue blocks used for DNA purification. In those cases in which the neoplastic content was <50%, we microdissected the lesions to enrich the neoplastic content to >50%. Primers were designed to amplify the region containing the two TERT mutations that were previously described—C228T and C250T—corresponding to the positions 124 and 146 bp, respectively, upstream of the TERT ATG start site (14, 15). The PCR fragments were then purified and analyzed by conventional Sanger sequencing.  In all, we evaluated TERT promoter mutations in 1,230 tumor specimens and identified 231 mutations (18.8%) (Table 1). C228T and C250T mutations accounted for 77.5% and 20.8% of the alterations, respectively (Dataset S1). Additionally, we detected four mutations that had not been observed previously: three C228A mutations and one C229A mutation (Dataset S1). All four of these mutations as well as a representative subset of the C228T and C250T mutations (n = 59) were somatic, as evidenced by their absence in normal tissues of the patients containing the mutations in their tumors.  Table 1. Table 1. Frequency of TERT promoter mutations The 1,230 tumors represented 60 tumor types. In 26 of these tumor types, at least 15 individual tumors were evaluated (comprising a total of 1,043 individual tumors) (Fig. 1). In the remaining tumor types, only a small number of samples (2–12) was available, in part because these tumor types are generally uncommon in Western populations (Table 1). Among the tumor types in which at least 15 individual tumors were available for study, a clear distinction could be made. Eighteen of these tumor types had only occasional TERT promoter mutations (zero to three mutations, comprising 0–15% of the tumors of each type) (Fig. 1). We classified these tumor types as TERT-low (TERT-L), because they had a low frequency of TERT promoter mutations. Eight other tumor types were classified as TERT-high (TERT-H) because of their relatively high prevalence of TERT promoter mutations (16–83% of the tumors of each type).  Fig. 1. Fig. 1. Frequency of TERT promoter mutations; 15 or more tumors were analyzed in 26 tumor types. Gliomas are divided into primary GBM, astrocytoma (including astrocytoma grades II and III, as well as secondary GBM), and oligodendroglioma. The TERT-L tumor types included some of the most prevalent cancers, including epithelial tumors of the breast, prostate, thyroid, pancreas, gall bladder, uterus, and colon (as well as tumors of the lung, stomach, and esophagus based on prior studies) (14, 15) and leukemias. In fact, no TERT mutations were identified in any specimen of 30 tumor types that we studied, comprising a total of 546 tumors (Table 1). Some nonepithelial cancers, such as synovial sarcomas, chordomas, neuroblastomas, osteosarcomas, and ependymomas, were also TERT-L.  Eight TERT-H tumor types were identified (in addition to the previously described melanomas) (14, 15). These tumors included tumors of the CNS, transitional cell carcinomas of the urinary tract, hepatocellular carcinomas, myxoid liposarcomas, and oral cavity carcinomas. Although only a small number of TERT-H tumors (other than melanomas) were examined in previous studies (15), mutations in gliomas, hepatocellular, and oral cavity carcinomas were detected, which would be expected on the basis of the high frequency of mutation in these tumors types (Table 1).  Clinical and Molecular Correlations in TERT-H Tumors. Sarcomas. One of the highest frequencies of TERT promoter mutation was found in myxoid liposarcoma (19 of 24 tumors, 79% with mutation). Myxoid liposarcomas account for more than one-third of all liposarcomas and ∼10% of all adult soft tissue sarcomas (16). Patients are relatively young, with a peak age range between 30 and 50 y. At the genetic level, the most characteristic change is a t(12;16) (q13;p11) chromosomal translocation that results in the fusion of the FUS and DDIT3 genes (16, 17). The cellular origin of these tumors is unknown, but preadipocytic progenitor cells and mesenchymal stem cells have been implicated (18); after embryogenesis, the mitotic activity of these cells is thought to be low. Other sarcomas, also thought to originate from mesenchymal cells that do not self-renew in the absence of damage, were not TERT-H (Table 1). These sarcomas included synovial sarcomas (0% of 16 tumors) and osteosarcomas (4.3% of 23 tumors). Of note, myxoid liposarcomas have been previously shown to have a relatively high prevalence of ALT (24% of 38 tumors) (13, 19). The data, in aggregate, are compatible with the idea that myxoid liposarcomas almost always genetically activate telomere maintenance genes through either TERT promoter mutations or ALT.  Hepatocellular carcinomas. Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) are the third leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide, and their incidence is increasing in the United States (20). Most HCCs in the United States are associated with Hepatitis B or C Virus infection, whereas others are associated with alcoholic cirrhosis; 44% of HCC samples that we evaluated harbored TERT promoter mutations (27/61). This finding makes TERT the most commonly mutated gene yet observed in this tumor type (21, 22). The mutations seemed to occur relatively early in tumorigenesis, because they were observed in 39% of stage I well-differentiated HCCs (Table S1). TERT mutations were observed in virally associated tumors as well as cases without any underlying liver disease at similar frequencies (Table S1). There was also no difference in the prevalence of TERT promoter mutations with respect to sex, age, or ethnicity (Table S1). ALT has been observed in 7% of 121 HCCs studied previously (13).  Urinary tract cancers. Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder is the fourth most common type of cancer in American males. In 2013, over 73,000 patients will be diagnosed with bladder cancer leading to approximately 15,000 deaths in the US alone (23). Two-thirds of the 21 urothelial carcinomas of the bladder that we studied harbored TERT promoter mutations. We were also able to evaluate 19 urothelial carcinomas of the upper urinary tract, a much less common anatomic site for this histopathologic subtype of tumor. Nine of nineteen upper urinary tract urothelial carcinomas harbored TERT mutations. TERT mutations are, therefore, the most frequently mutated genes yet identified in urothelial carcinoma of either the bladder or upper urinary tract (24). The prevalence of ALT in bladder cancers is very low (1% of 188 cancers) (13).  Head and neck cancers. Head and neck cancers are almost always squamous cell carcinomas and can occur throughout the oral cavity lining (mucous membranes of the cheek, hard and soft palate, tongue, supraglottis, etc.). It is the sixth most common cancer in the world, and 50,000 cases occurred in the United States in 2012. We identified TERT promoter mutations in 17% of 70 oral cavity cancers that we evaluated. However, the anatomic distribution of the cases with TERT promoter mutations was striking: 11 of 12 cancers with TERT promoter mutations were in the oral tongue, although only 23 of 70 total cases originated in the oral tongue (P < 0.0001, Fisher exact probability test, two-tailed) (Table S2). The basis for this extraordinary selectivity is curious given the shared characteristics of the squamous epithelium lining the tongue and other parts of the head and neck, including the oral cavity. Moreover, we evaluated 22 squamous cell carcinomas of another site (the cervix) and found only one TERT mutation (4.5%) (Table 1). Most cervical squamous cell carcinomas and a subset of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas are caused by human papillomavirus, which can activate telomerase by expressing E6 and E7 viral oncogenes (25). These findings raise the possibility that human papillomavirus infection and TERT mutation may be alternative mechanisms to activate telomerase among squamous cell carcinomas. We were unable to test correlations between TERT promoter mutations and HPV status or other clinical parameters because of the small number of patients with available data (Table S2). There have been no ALT cases identified among 70 head and neck cancers, including 41 oral cavity cancers (13).  Medulloblastomas. Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor of childhood (26). TERT mutations occurred in 21% of 91 medulloblastomas that we evaluated. As with the oral cavity cancers, TERT mutations were not distributed randomly among the medulloblastoma patients. Although medulloblastomas are usually diagnosed at a young age, those medulloblastomas with TERT mutations were diagnosed at a considerably older age (median = 6 vs. 16 y, P = 0.0012, t test assuming unequal variances, two-tailed) (Fig. S1A). This observation has important implications for understanding the basis for the selectivity of the tumor types harboring TERT promoter mutations (Discussion); 45 of 90 patients had been assessed previously for orthodenticle homeobox 2 (OTX2) gene amplification and expression, and alterations in this transcription factor are known to correlate with clinically distinct molecular subtypes of medulloblastoma (27). OTX2 expression was >100-fold higher in medulloblastoma patients without TERT promoter mutations than in those patients with TERT promoter mutations (note the log scale in Fig. S1B). The high levels of OTX2 expression were usually the result of OTX2 gene amplification (Fig. S1C). The association of TERT promoter mutations with an older age at diagnosis and a lack of OTX2 overexpression raises the possibility that TERT mutations occur in a specific clinical and molecular subtype of medulloblastoma. The most likely molecular subtype of medulloblastoma that may be enriched for TERT mutations is the noninfant sonic hedgehog subtype, which is characterized by an older age at diagnosis and lower expression of OTX2 (28, 29). Larger studies will be needed to make this association more definitive. ALT has been observed in 7% of 55 medulloblastomas studied previously (13).  Gliomas. Gliomas are the most common CNS tumor type and accounted for >14,000 deaths in the United States last year (30). Histopathological and clinical criteria established by the World Health Organization are used to characterize these tumors into several subtypes (30). We considered the four main subtypes individually (Table S3).  Primary glioblastoma. These primary glioblastomas (GBMs) are the most common malignant brain tumors in adults, accounting for ∼17% of all intracranial tumors, and they confer the worst survival (median of ∼15 mo) (31). These high-grade (grade IV) tumors have no detectable precursor lesions and have been referred to as de novo tumors. The prevalence of TERT promoter mutations was remarkably high in GBMs of adults (83% of 78 tumors) (Table S3). This prevalence is higher than the prevalence of any other genetic mutation in this tumor type (32). These findings provide a molecular mechanism responsible for the high levels of TERT mRNA and telomerase activity observed in GBMs (33).  For 51 of 78 primary GBM tumors, data on other common genetic alterations as well as clinical data were available (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, EGFR amplification, a classic molecular feature of primary GBM, exclusively occurred in tumors with TERT mutations (P = 0.0006, Fisher exact probability test, two-tailed). Conversely, no association was identified between TERT mutation and either TP53 mutation or CDKN2A deletion. Importantly, the frequency of TERT promoter mutations was considerably less in primary GBMs of pediatric patients (11% of 19 tumors) than adult patients (Discussion) (Table S3). ALT was observed in 11% of 105 adult GBM and 44% of pediatric GBM (i.e., the reverse of the pattern observed for TERT promoter mutations) (13). Primary GBM patients without TERT mutations survived considerably longer, on average, than patients with such mutations (median = 27 vs. 14 mo, P = 0.01 by the log rank test) (Fig. S3).  Fig. 2. Fig. 2. Mutations of selected genes in glioma subtypes. (A) Distribution of TERT mutations and other genetic events in 51 primary GBMs. (B) Distribution of TERT mutations and other genetic events among 40 astrocytomas, including grades II–III astrocytomas ... Astrocytomas. Infiltrative astrocytic tumors frequently progress, with recurrent lesions often of higher grade than the original lesions excised at surgery. They are most often grade II or III but can progress to grade IV (at which point they are often termed secondary GBMs). Astrocytomas of any stage rarely contained TERT promoter mutations (10% of 40 total samples) (Table S3). Instead, they more frequently contained isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) or isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) mutations (75% of 40 tumors), ATRX mutations (70% of 40 tumors), and TP53 mutations (73% of 40 tumors) (Fig. 2B). ALT has been observed in 63% of 57 astrocytomas, consistent with the high prevalence of ATRX mutations (13). The lack of activating TERT mutations in IDH1 mutant tumors is also corroborated by the lack of TERT mRNA and telomerase activity observed in these lesions (33).  Oligodendrogliomas. Like astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas often progress, and they frequently contain TERT promoter mutations (78% of 45 tumor samples) (Table S3). Oligodendroglioma was the only tumor type studied (of all types, including non-CNS tumors) (Dataset S1) in which C250T mutations were nearly as frequent as C228T mutations. In oligodendrogliomas, 43% of tumors with TERT mutations contained C250T substitutions, whereas in other gliomas, only 10% did (P < 0.001, Fisher exact probability test, two-tailed). Interestingly, 91% of 45 oligodendrogliomas that were evaluated for ATRX and TERT sequence alterations contained either an ATRX coding or a TERT promoter mutation, suggesting that genetic alterations resulting in telomere maintenance are required for tumorigenesis of this subtype.  Oligodendrogliomas have long been known to contain characteristic losses of chromosome arms 1p and 19q, and these losses reflect inactivation of the CIC gene on chromosome 19q and in some cases, inactivation of the FUBP1 gene on chromosome 1p (34–36). Accordingly, 78% of 45 oligodendrogliomas contained chromosome arm 1p or 19q losses of heterozygosity (Fig. 2C) (34–36). Moreover, nearly all of them contained IDH1 or IDH2 mutations (93%).  Oligoastrocytomas. As their name implies, these tumors are mixed, with histologic features of both oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas. This mixture, in part, reflects the difficulties in distinguishing the various glioma subtypes from one another on the basis of histopathologic or clinical criteria (37). The genetic features of this tumor subtype reflect this mixture: the prevalence of TERT promoter mutations (25% of 24 tumors) was intermediate between oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas, as were the frequencies of chromosome (Chr) 1p/19q losses and IDH1/2, TP53, and ATRX mutations (Fig. 2D).  ALT Vs. TERT. ALT has been observed in tumors of the CNS (particularly gliomas) more frequently than tumors of any other tissue type. Given that TERT promoter mutations are also common in gliomas, the relationship between these two features could be determined with high confidence. The tumors depicted in Fig. 2 had previously been evaluated for alterations in ATRX, which is a nearly perfect surrogate for the ALT phenotype (11, 37). Our data show that there were 50 gliomas with ATRX mutations and 83 gliomas with TERT mutations; 0 of 83 tumors with TERT mutations contained ATRX mutations (P < 0.0001, Fisher exact probability test, two-tailed).  Go to: DISCUSSION The results described above, as well as the results published in refs. 14 and 15, provide evidence that supports one of the hypotheses raised in the Introduction and refutes others. The first of these hypotheses was that TERT mutations would only be observed in tumors derived from tissues that are not constantly self-renewing under normal circumstances. This hypothesis was supported in part: the vast majority of TERT promoter mutations occurred in tumors derived from tissues that do not continually self-renew. The TERT-H tumor types include only melanomas, certain subtypes of glioma, medulloblastomas, squamous cell cancers of the tongue, liposarcomas, HCCs, and urinary tract cancers. The normal transitional cells of the urinary tract have very low proliferative indices (0.64% ± 0.52%), much lower than indices of gastrointestinal tract, bone marrow, or skin (38). Normal hepatocytes also do not turnover often (39), and glial cells are thought to have limited capacity for self-renewal (40).  Two other observations also support the hypothesis. Pediatric primary GBMs rarely contained TERT mutations (11%), whereas adult primary GBMs frequently did (83%). Pediatric GBMs are presumably derived from cells that are still dividing at the time of tumor initiation, and therefore, there is no selective advantage conferred by activating telomerase through a genetic mutation. Adult GBMs, in contrast, are presumably derived from postmitotic cells, and they should require telomerase activation. Similarly, medulloblastomas are embryonal tumors that typically arise from precursor cells with high self-renewal rates that do not usually persist in adults. This finding is consistent with our observation that the mean age of medulloblastoma patients with TERT mutations was considerably older than the mean age of medulloblastoma patients without TERT mutations (Fig. S1A).  There are, however, exceptions that belie the hypothesis that TERT mutations occur only in non–self-renewing tissues. The epithelium that lines the tongue constantly self-renews, but many squamous carcinomas of the tongue harbored TERT mutations (Table S2). Additionally, the squamous epithelia of the tongue certainly would not be expected to self-renew less than other squamous epithelia of the oral cavity, but the latter rarely harbored TERT mutations (Table S2). This finding may suggest that squamous carcinomas of the tongue originate from a different cell of origin than other oral cavity squamous carcinomas. Conversely, only a subset of the tumor types derived from non–self-renewing tissues was TERT-H. For example, the TERT-H tumors included myxoid liposarcomas but not synovial sarcomas. Moreover, cells of the pancreas (the islets of Langerhans and the ductal epithelial cells) rarely renew, but pancreatic tumors of all types (pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, acinar carcinomas, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas) were all TERT-L. The most that we can conclude at present is that non–self-renewing cell types are the major sources of TERT-H tumors but that non–self-renewal is only one of the factors that determines whether tumor cells with TERT promoter mutations will have a selective growth advantage over adjoining cells.  The first corollary to the hypothesis raised in the Introduction was that tumor types that displayed ALT would be those types that harbored TERT promoter mutations. This corollary is soundly refuted by these data, at least in general terms. Although tumor types of the CNS and liposarcomas had high frequencies of ALT as well as high frequencies of TERT promoter mutations, these tumor types were the exceptions rather than the rule. For example, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors have very high frequencies of ALT but no evidence of TERT mutations. Conversely, bladder cancers frequently have TERT mutations but never have ALT (13). Additionally, even among gliomas, pediatric GBMs have high frequencies of ALT and low frequencies of TERT mutations, whereas adult GBMs have the reverse pattern.  The second corollary was that the selective advantage afforded by TERT mutation would be equivalent to the advantage afforded by ATRX mutation (conferring ALT). This hypothesis was most effectively tested in gliomas, in which both ATRX coding and TERT promoter mutations were common. There was a striking mutual exclusivity with respect to ATRX and TERT mutations (P < 0.0001), lending strong support to this idea.  These results also raise many unanswered questions. In some tumor types, such as gliomas, we can imagine that all tumors have genetically activated telomere maintenance programs through mutations in either TERT or ATRX. However, in other tumor types with frequent ATRX mutations, such as pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, what is responsible for activating telomerase in the fraction of cases not exhibiting ALT if it is not a mutation in the TERT promoter? Similarly, what is responsible for activating telomerase in those tumors derived from non–self-renewing cell types in which neither ALT nor TERT mutations is frequently observed, such as synovial sarcomas or osteosarcomas? Also, there are occasional individual tumors among the TERT-L types that have TERT promoter mutations (e.g., cervical cancers, ovarian cancers, and in ref. 15, lung cancers). What distinguishes these occasional cancers from others of the same histopathologic subtype? Whole-genome sequencing studies, rather than those studies limited to the exome, might provide answers to these questions.  The results recorded here have practical as well as basic scientific implications. Two-thirds of bladder cancers had TERT promoter mutations, making it the most commonly mutated gene yet identified in invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. Given the persistently high mortality rate despite multimodality treatment in this group of patients, these mutations represent ideal urinary biomarkers to detect bladder cancers at an early stage and to follow patients for evidence of progression or recurrence once they have been diagnosed (41). Similarly, the high prevalence of TERT promoter mutations in HCCs and glioma subtypes provides excellent candidate biomarkers for early detection (HCC) or monitoring (HCC in the plasma and gliomas in the cerebrospinal fluid) (42, 43).  Another practical implication involves diagnostics. We conjecture that tumors with TERT promoter or ATRX mutations are derived from different precursor cells and that either type of precursor cell is different from those types that are the precursors of tumors without such mutations. This distinction could aid classification of the tumors in clinically meaningful ways. For example, Fig. 2 and Fig. S2 outline the major genetic alterations occurring in the three most common types of gliomas. On the basis of the data in Fig. 2 A–C, we speculate that oligodendrogliomas that lack TERT mutations but contain ATRX mutations may behave more like astrocytomas than oligodendrogliomas and vice versa. Similarly, the primary GBMs without TERT mutations (15% of the total) may behave more like advanced progressive astrocytomas, which generally lack TERT mutations. This possibility is supported by the observation that those primary GBM patients without TERT mutations had a longer survival, on average, than other primary GBM patients (Fig. S3).  Go to: METHODS All clinical information and tissue were obtained with consent and Institutional Review Board approval from the various institutions donating material to this study, and they were obtained in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Tissue sections were reviewed by board-certified pathologists to ensure that ≥50% of the cells used for DNA purification were neoplastic and confirm histopathological diagnosis. Oligonucleotides with the sequences 5′-M13-GGCCGATTCGACCTCTCT-3′ and 5′-AGCACCTCGCGGTAGTGG-3′, where M13 is a universal sequencing priming site with sequence 5′-tgtaaaacgacggccagt-3′, were used to PCR-amplify the proximal TERT promoter containing C228 and C250 (chr5: 1,295,228; chr5: 1,295,250, respectively; hg19) for Sanger sequencing using standard methods (44). Primary GBM copy number data as well as ALT status were derived from the data published in refs. 37, 45, and 46, and OTX2 copy number expression was derived from the data published in ref. 27. Brain tumor patients were treated at the Tisch Brain Tumor Center at Duke. For the purposes of this study, secondary GBM designates a GBM that was resected >1 y after a prior diagnosis of a lower-grade glioma (grades I–III), and all other GBMs were considered to be primary GBMs. Pediatric GBM samples were defined as those samples occurring before 21 y of age.
29||Heterozygous mutations in the telomerase components TERT, the reverse transcriptase, and TERC, the RNA template, cause autosomal dominant dyskeratosis congenita due to telomere shortening. Anticipation, whereby the disease severity increases in succeeding generations due to inheritance of shorter telomeres, is a feature of this condition. Here we describe 2 families in which 2 TERT mutations are segregating. Both families contain compound heterozygotes. In one case the proband is homozygous for a novel mutation causing a P704S substitution, while his father's second allele encodes an H412Y mutation. The proband in the second family has mutant alleles Y846C and H876Q. Transfection studies show codominant expression of the mutated alleles with no evidence of a dominant negative effect or of intragenic complementation. Thus in these families the expression of both TERT alleles and the inherited telomere length contribute to the clinical phenotype.  Go to: Introduction Mutations in genes encoding components of the telomerase ribonucleoprotein complex resulting in very short telomeres have been identified in patients with dyskeratosis congenita (DC), a rare inherited bone marrow failure syndrome.1–6 X-linked DC is caused by mutations in the DKC1 gene, encoding a protein necessary for the stabilization of the TERC RNA. Individuals with autosomal dominant DC (AD DC) are heterozygous for mutations in the telomerase RNA TERC or the gene encoding the catalytic subunit TERT.2–5 In contrast to patients with X-linked DC, who usually develop severe disease with a high penetrance, disease penetrance and expressivity in AD DC are highly variable and, in addition to the gene mutation, the inheritance of short telomeres is required for the manifestation of the disease.7,8 Here we demonstrate that the inheritance of AD DC may be complex. We report a DC patient homozygous for a TERT mutation and compound heterozygotes in 2 separate families with apparent codominance of the 2 mutations  Go to: Methods Clinical and genetic information was obtained through our ongoing study on the molecular mechanisms of bone marrow failure (http://bmf.im.wustl.edu). The study is approved by the Washington University School of Medicine Institutional Review Board. Informed consent was obtained in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. DNA for mutation analysis was extracted from peripheral blood cells (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Telomere length measurements in peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMC) by flow-FISH and direct DNA sequencing were previously described.8 Primers used are shown in Table S1 (available on the Blood website; see the Supplemental Materials link at the top of the online article).  The mutations identified were introduced in the p3.1+ TERT plasmid9 using the QuickChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Wild-type (WT) or mutant TERT plasmid (4 μg) were transfected into WI-38 VA-13 cells at 80% confluence in the presence of an equal amount of pUC TERC using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).10 In cotransfection experiments, 2 μg of each mutant TERT plasmid were used. Thirty-six hours after transfection, telomerase activities were determined in cell lysates at protein concentrations of 40, 10, 2.5, and 0.625 ng using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR)–based TRAP assay as previously described.11  Go to: Results and discussion Figure 1A shows the pedigrees of families 199 and 284. Patient 199.1 is a 31-year-old man of Scottish descent. His clinical manifestations include short stature; elfin appearance; esophageal stricture; leukoplakia of the buccal mucosa, anus, and penis; abnormal pigmentation of his neck, trunk, and back; hyperkeratosis of his palms; ridged fingernails; avascular necrosis of both hips; tooth loss; chronic diarrhea; learning difficulties; pulmonary infiltrates; and progressive bone marrow failure (Figure 1B). His 61-year-old father was diagnosed with osteoporosis at the age of 60. His 60-year-old mother is healthy. Both parents have normal peripheral blood cell counts. The paternal grandmother (age, 84 years) has a history of anemia, osteoporosis, and pulmonary fibrosis. The maternal grandmother was reported to have died at the age of 60 years because of pulmonary fibrosis.  Figure 1 Figure 1 Pedigrees and clinical manifestations in TERT mutations (A) Pedigrees and identified TERT gene mutations in families 199 and 284. Circles, females; squares, males; white, wild type; color, mutant as indicated in the chart. Half-filled symbols indicate ... Mutation analysis revealed that patient 199.1 is homozygous for a C to T transition in exon 5 of the TERT gene (cDNA nt C2110T) causing a proline to serine substitution at amino acid 704 (P704S). Functional analysis in WI-38 VA-13 cells demonstrated that the TERT P704S mutation severely reduces telomerase activity to 13% of normal (P < .001; Figure 2A). Both parents are heterozygous for the TERT P704S mutation (Figure 1A). Interestingly, however, the father carries a second TERT mutation in exon 2. This C1234T mutation (H412Y), has been previously described in an unrelated family.3 This mutation reduced telomerase activity to 36% of normal in our transfection experiments (P < .001; Figure 2A). Coexpression of WT TERT with either the P704S or H412Y variants did not show evidence of a dominant negative effect. The coexpression of the 2 TERT mutations resulted in an intermediate telomerase activity of 22% (P < .001; Figure 2B), suggesting a synergic effect on telomerase activity and no intragenic complementation. Careful analysis of the family tree revealed that the parents are fourth cousins, explaining the presence of the TERT P704S mutation in both parents.  Figure 2 Figure 2 Telomerase activity and telomere lengths of wild-type and mutant individuals. (A) In vitro telomerase activity of the mutant TERT proteins in WI-38 VA-13 cells. WI-38 VA-13 cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing the mutant TERT cDNA sequences ... Telomere length measurement in family 199 revealed that patient 199.1 has very short telomeres (below the 1st percentile of the normal telomere length distribution; Figure 2C). Interestingly, the father (199.2), who is compound heterozygous for the TERT P704S and H412Y mutations, has also very short telomeres, whereas the mother (199.3), who is heterozygous for TERT P704S mutation, has a normal telomere length.  Patient 284.1 is an 8-year-old girl of European descent, originally diagnosed with moderate but progressive aplastic anemia. Both of her parents are healthy with no abnormalities in the peripheral blood. Family history was negative for blood diseases, pulmonary fibrosis, or cancer.  Mutation analysis revealed 2 different TERT gene sequence alterations. The A2537G in exon 9 (Y846C) and C2628G mutation in exon 10 (H876Q). Further analysis showed that the TERT Y846C mutation was inherited from the mother, whereas the TERT H876Q mutation was inherited from her father, indicating that patient 284.1 is a compound heterozygote for the 2 TERT gene mutations (Figure 1A). Both TERT gene mutations result in a significantly reduced telomerase activity after transfection into WI-38 VA-13 cells to 10% (P < .001) and 50% (P < .001) of normal (Figure 2A), whereas the cotransfection of the 2 mutants results in a telomerase activity of 38% (P = .004; Figure 2B).  Telomere length in peripheral blood cells from patient 284.1 was very short, below the 1st percentile of normal and so were those measured in her mother (284.2) and in one of her uncles (284.4), both of whom carry the TERT Y846C mutation. Telomere length in her father (284.3) heterozygous for the TERT H876Q mutation was between the 1st and 5th percentile of normal (Figure 2C).  In conclusion, we have identified 3 novel and 1 recurrent TERT gene mutation in 2 families who were thought to have sporadic DC and idiopathic aplastic anemia. All 4 mutations are hypomorphic mutations, impairing, but not eliminating telomerase activity. Homozygous hypomorphic TERT mutations have recently been found to cause disease in 2 consanguineous families.12 Here we demonstrate that in a nonconsanguineous family compound heterozygosity for TERT can cause disease and that the involvement of TERT in the pathogenesis of DC is probably more complex than initially anticipated. Our data indicate that in compound heterozygosity or homozygosity for hypomorphic TERT mutations the mutant alleles are codominant and suggest that severity of telomerase dysfunction and the inheritance of short telomeres determine the clinical phenotype and onset of disease. Codominant inheritance has also been found in one family with 2 hypomorphic TERC gene mutations,13 whereas compound heterozygosity or homozygosity for TERC or TERT null mutations have never been reported, suggesting that in humans, in contrast to mice, biallelic TERC or TERT null mutations are probably not compatible with life. The consideration that both sides of the family may be affected even in nonconsanguineous families might have important implications for the patient in the selection of a potential sibling donor as well as for the prognosis and management of other family members carrying one or 2 of the identified gene mutations.

31||Sequencing studies have identified many recurrent coding mutations in human cancer genes; however, highly recurrent mutations involving regulatory regions have rarely been observed. Here we describe two independent mutations within the TERT core promoter that, when taken together, were observed in 71% (50 of 70) of melanomas and generate de novo consensus ETS binding motifs. Reporter assays showed that these mutations increase transcriptional activity from the TERT promoter by 2–4-fold. Examination of cancer cell lines derived from diverse tumor types revealed the same mutations in 16% (24 of 150) of cases, with preliminary evidence of elevated frequency in bladder and hepatocellular cancer cells. Thus, somatic mutations in regulatory regions of the genome may represent an important tumorigenic mechanism.  Systematic characterization of human cancer genomes has led to the discovery of a wide range of mutated genes that contribute to tumor development and progression. Most of the somatic mutations in tumors reside within the protein-coding regions of genes or at splice junctions. To determine whether tumor genomes harbor recurrent mutations outside of protein-coding regions, we systematically queried noncoding somatic mutations using published whole-genome sequencing data.  Analysis of whole-genome sequencing data from malignant melanomas (1, 2) revealed two somatic telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene promoter mutations in 17 of 19 (89%) cases examined. The average sequence coverage at the TERT promoter locus was 30-fold in normal samples and 60-fold in tumor samples (fig. S1A). Each of these promoter mutations resulted in a cytidine-to-thymidine transition at a dipyrimidine motif indicative of ultraviolet (UV) light–induced damage (chr5, 1,295,228 C>T and 1,295,250 C>T; hereafter termed C228T and C250T, respectively), and both mutations localized within 100 base pairs (bp) of the TERT transcriptional start site (TSS) (mean allelic fraction, 0.32; range, 0.07 to 0.55) (table S1). We validated these mutations by means of polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing tumor/normal sample pairs from both the discovery set (Fig. 1A and fig. S1, B and C) and an extension set of 51 additional melanoma tumor/normal sample pairs. Within this extension set, 33 tumors (65%) harbored one of the mutations. Moreover, the mutations were mutually exclusive in both the discovery and extension sets (P = 5.4 × 10−7, Fisher’s one-sided exact test). Two tumors with a C228T transition also contained an adjacent C>T transition (at position chr5, 1,295,229), which is indicative of a dinucleotide CC>TT transition. Together, these TERT promoter mutations were observed in 50 of 70 (71%; 95% confidence interval: 59 to 82%, Clopper-Pearson method) melanomas examined (Fig. 1B and table S1).  Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Identification of TERT promoter mutations in melanoma and cancer cell lines Both C228T and C250T generated an identical 11-bp nucleotide stretch (5′-CCCCTTCCGGG-3′) containing a consensus binding site for E-twenty-six (ETS) transcription factors (GGAA, reverse complement) within the TERT promoter region. Because ETS transcription factors may become activated through dysregulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) signaling, we hypothesized that these promoter mutations might augment gene expression. To test this hypothesis, we used a reporter assay system in which the relevant portion of the mutant or wild-type TERT core promoter was cloned upstream of the firefly luciferase gene (2). Here, we tested both a core promoter fragment (−132 to +5 relative to the TSS) and the full core promoter (−200 to +73). In comparison to the wild-type TERT promoter, both mutations conferred approximately two- to fourfold increased transcriptional activity in five distinct cell line contexts (Fig. 1C and fig. S1D). Thus, each mutation was capable of augmenting transcriptional activity from the TERT promoter.  To investigate whether similar TERT promoter mutations occur in other cancer types, we examined sequencing data from this locus in 150 cell lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) (3). Overall, 24 CCLE lines (16%) contained either C228T or C250T (mean allelic fraction, 0.61; range, 0.17 to 1.00) (table S1). An increased frequency in melanoma was again noted (five of six lines tested), with additional evidence suggesting possible heightened prevalence (>25%; one-sided 95% confidence interval) in bladder (three of three lines) and hepatocellular cancer cell lines (four of six lines) (Fig. 1D).  Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that these promoter mutations may function as driver events that contribute to oncogenesis through TERT dysregulation and undergo positive selection, at least in human melanoma. First, the TERT promoter mutations showed a combined frequency that exceeded those of BRAF and NRAS mutations, which activate known melanoma driver oncogenes (4, 5). In an analysis restricted to somatic mutations present at an allelic fraction of 0.2 or greater [to reduce artifacts of mutation calling (1)], the four most recurrent melanoma nucleotide substitutions included BRAF [chr7, 140,453,136 A>T (V600E)], NRAS [chr1, 115,256,529 T>C (Q61R)], and the TERT core promoter mutations C228T and C250T. Second, although highly recurrent, C228T and C250T occurred in a wholly mutually exclusive fashion. This suggests the possibility that the mutations might be functionally redundant. Third, the absence of other recurrent somatic mutations in the 3 kb upstream of the TERT transcription start site in the queried melanomas (1) coupled with the absence of the described TERT promoter mutations in 24 lung adenocarcinomas with comparably high somatic mutation rates (6) reduces the possibility that these recurrent TERT promoter mutations are solely due to an increased background mutation rate at this locus. Although the role of telomerase in tumorigenesis is well established, details regarding its dysregulation in cancer cells remain incompletely understood, particularly in melanoma (7). The TERT promoter mutations identified here may link telomerase gene regulation and tumorigenic activation in this malignancy. The high prevalence of C228T and C250T suggests that these TERT promoter mutations may comprise early genetic events in the genesis of melanoma and other cancer types. Although TERT expression alone is not sufficient to bypass oncogene-induced senescence, genomic TERT activation may potentiate mechanisms by which melanocytes achieve immortalization in the setting of oncogenic mutations (8). These results therefore suggest that renewed efforts to develop clinically effective telomerase inhibitors may be warranted.  At the same time, promoter mutations likely represent only one potential mechanism of TERT reactivation in a subset of human cancers. Indeed, recurrent chromosomal copy gains spanning the TERT locus have been described previously for several cancers, including melanoma (9, 10).  Highly recurrent somatic mutations within a cancer gene promoter region have not previously been described. Similarly, the de novo mutational generation of transcription factor binding motifs in tumor genomes was heretofore unknown, although an ETS transcription factor binding motif was previously associated with a single-nucleotide polymorphism insertion at the MMP-1 locus (11). Together, these findings raise the possibility that recurrent somatic mutations involving regulatory regions, in addition to coding sequences, may represent important driver events in cancer.  TERT Promoter Mutations in Familial and Sporadic Melanoma Susanne Horn,1,2 Adina Figl,1,2 P. Sivaramakrishna Rachakonda,1 Christine Fischer,3 Antje Sucker,2 Andreas Gast,1,2 Stephanie Kadel,1,2 Iris Moll,2 Eduardo Nagore,4 Kari Hemminki,1,5 Dirk Schadendorf,2 *† Rajiv Kumar1 *† Cutaneous melanoma occurs in both familial and sporadic forms. We investigated a melanoma-prone family through linkage analysis and high-throughput sequencing and identified a disease-segregating germline mutation in the promoter of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene, which encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase. The mutation creates a new binding motif for Ets transcription factors and ternary complex factors (TCFs) near the transcription start and, in reporter gene assays, caused up to twofold increase in transcription. We then screened the TERT promoter in sporadic melanoma and observed recurrent ultraviolet signature somatic mutations in 125 of 168 (74%) of human cell lines derived from metastatic melanomas, 45 of 53 corresponding metastatic tumor tissues (85%), and 25 of 77 (33%) primary melanomas. The majority of those mutations occurred at two positions in the TERT promoter and also generated binding motifs for Ets/TCF transcription factors. The identification of germline mutations that cosegregate with disease in cancerprone families often provides genetic and mechanistic insights into the more common, sporadically arising cancers. In a study of cutaneous melanoma, the most malignant skin cancer, we investigated a large pedigree with 14 related melanoma patients who were not carriers of germline mutations in CDKN2A or CDK4, two known melanoma genes (Fig. 1). Multipoint linkage analysis showed a possible 2.2-Mb linkage region on chromosome 5p with maximal logarithm of the odds ratio for linkage scores of 2.35 at rs1379917 and 2.45 at rs1968011. Target-enriched high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of the region was carried out on constitutional DNA from the four affected and four unaffected members of the family with an average coverage between 55- and 108-fold (table S1) (1). The HTS data revealed a single promoter variant, three intronic variants, and three nongene variants previously unknown and unique to the DNA sequences of the affected individuals (table S2). The disease segregating variants, seven in total, were validated by Sanger sequencing of DNA from the individuals sequenced by HTS and of DNA from additional unaffected members of the family. The new variants were also detected in an unaffected member (754, table S3), who was 36 years old and carried multiple nevi. DNA from affected individuals other than those sequenced by HTS was not available for testing. Of the seven unique variants identified, one variant (T>G), was located in the promoter at –57 base pairs (bp) from ATG translation start site of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT ) gene. The TERT gene encodes the catalytic reverse transcriptase subunit of telomerase, the ribonucleoprotein complex that maintains telomere length. The nucleotide change in the sequence CCTGAA>CCGGAA creates a new binding motif for Ets transcription factors, with a general recognition motif GGA(A/T). Beyond the general motif for Ets transcription factors, the familial mutation also generates a binding motif, CCGGAA, for the ternary complex factors (TCFs) Elk1 and Elk4 (2, 3). To exclude the possibility that the detected promoter mutation in TERT is a common germline variant, we screened germline DNA from 140 sporadic melanoma cases and 165 healthy controls, and none carried the variant. Screening of DNA from index cases from 34 Spanish melanoma families also did not show any mutations. No carriers were found in dbSNP and the 1000 Genomes databases (data available for 18 individuals were obtained from Ensembl). The familial mutation in the TERT promoter was in complete allelic linkage with a common polymorphism rs2853669 (G>A) at –246 bp upstream from the ATG start site (table S3). In previous work, this polymorphism was reported to disrupt an Ets binding site, and it was associated with low telomerase activity in patients with non– small cell lung cancer (4). In luciferase reporter gene assays, we found that the activity of constructs containing the mutation at –57 bp of the TERT promoter was increased 1.5-fold and 1.2- fold over the wild-type construct in Ma-Mel-86a and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells, respectively. A construct with both the TERT mutation and the variant allele of the rs2853669 polymorphism showed a 2.2-fold increase in promoter activity in Ma-Mel-86a and and 1.3-fold increase in HEK293 cells (mean from three measurements; details in supplementary text and fig. S1). The germline occurrence of the promoter mutation, creating an Ets/TCF motif, can result in modification of TERT expression in all tissues expressing Ets/TCF. Highest staining for the TCF Elk1 protein has been reported in female-specific tissues, such as ovary and placenta. The increased expression of TCF Elk1 protein in female-specific tissues may cause gender-related differences in 1 Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Center, Im Neuenheimer Feld 580, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany. 2 Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Essen, 45122 Essen, Germany. 3 Institute of Human Genetics, University of Heidelberg, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany. 4 Department of Dermatology, Instituto Valenciano de Oncologia, Valencia, Spain. 5 Center for Primary Health Care Research, Lund University, Malmö, Sweden. *To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Two affected members of the family developed several different types of cancer (marked with # in Fig. 1). One affected individual presented with ovarian cancer at age 27 and melanoma at age 30. Another individual was diagnosed with melanoma at age 20; later she developed ovarian cancer, renal cell carcinoma, bladder cancer, mammary carcinoma, and finally bronchial carcinoma, leading to her death at age 50. The mutation in the melanoma-prone family prompted us to screen melanoma cell lines derived from sporadic cases of metastatic melanoma. None of the cell lines carried the mutation detected in the family. However, we identified recurrent ultraviolet (UV)–signature mutations in the TERT core promoter in 74% (125 of 168) of the cell lines. The mutations were located within a 49-bp region starting from –100 bp upstream of the ATG start site (Table 1, Fig. 2, fig. S2, and table S4). There were two frequent mutations at –124 bp (G>A; C>T on opposite strand) and –146 bp (G>A); these mutations were mutually exclusive and occurred in 27 and 38% of cell lines, respectively. Two tandem GG>AA (CC>TT) mutations at positions –124/–125 bp and –138/–139 bp were observed at a frequency of 9%. The tandem mutation at positions –138/–139 bp could also be generated by a single-base mutation at –138 bp, because the base change at –139 bp has been reported as a rare polymorphism (rs35550267). The two most frequent single-base mutations as well as the two tandem mutations also result in the creation of Ets/TCF binding motifs. Mutations were confirmed in 45 of 53 (85%) available metastasized tumors corresponding to the cell lines. The somatic nature of the mutations was shown by the absence of mutations in corresponding DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells available from 23 patients. Somatic mutations in the TERT promoter were more frequent than the BRAF mutations (53%, 90 of 169), CDKN2A alterations (50%, 84 of 169), and NRAS mutations (23%, 38 of 169; fig. S3). The occurrence of concomitant mutations in the TERT promoter and BRAF was more frequent (47%) than by random chance (40%) with an odds ratio (OR) of 3.2 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3 to 8.2]. Concomitant mutations in TERT, BRAF, and CDKN2Awere observed in 30% of cell lines compared with the expected frequency of such occurrence of 9% (OR 5.6, 95% CI 2.4 to 13.8). The high recurrence and specificity of the TERT promoter mutations, together with the preliminary evidence from reporter assays that they have a functional effect on transcription, suggest that these mutations are driver rather than passenger events. Extensive functional studies will be required to validate this hypothesis. The TERT promoter mutations were also detected in 25 out of 77 (33%) paraffin embedded primary melanoma tumors (Table 1 and table S5) at –124 bp (7/77; 9%) and –146 bp (5/77; 7%). Four primary tumors carried the GG>AA tandem mutations at –124/–125 bp, and eight primary tumors carried the GG>AA tandem mutations at –138/–139 bp. Reduced sensitivity to detect mutations in paraffin-embedded primary tumors because of contaminating normal cells cannot be ruled out. Primary tumors harbored five additional mutations in the TERT promoter, which were not present in metastases, and those did not generate Ets/TCF binding motifs. We also screened DNA extracted from 25 melanocytic nevi and only one carried a mutation at –101 bp, which did not create an Ets/TCF motif. For both primary tumors and melanocytic nevi, matched normal control DNA was not available for testing. The TERT coding region has been reported to be somatically mutated in 1% of cancers (14 cancer types, 1271 unique samples) (6). Mutations creating Ets/TCF binding motifs in the TERT promoter in melanoma have not been described in earlier sequencing projects. TCFs are a subfamily of Ets transcription factors; two members of this subfamily, Elk1 and Elk4, are downstream targets of BRAF and regulate the expression of many genes (7–11). Conceivably, TCF may represent a link between telomerase activity and the frequent BRAF activating mutations in melanoma (fig. S4) (12, 13). Lastly, whether TERT promoter mutations occur in other cancer types remains to be determined. We did not detect these mutations in a screen of 22 esophageal squamous cell c  Reactivation of telomerase has been implicated in human tumorigenesis, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we report the presence of recurrent somatic mutations in the TERT promoter in cancers of the central nervous system (43%), bladder (59%), thyroid (follicular cell-derived, 10%) and skin (melanoma, 29%). In thyroid cancers, the presence of TERT promoter mutations (when occurring together with BRAF mutations) is significantly associated with higher TERT mRNA expression, and in glioblastoma we find a trend for increased telomerase expression in cases harbouring TERT promoter mutations. Both in thyroid cancers and glioblastoma, TERT promoter mutations are significantly associated with older age of the patients. Our results show that TERT promoter mutations are relatively frequent in specific types of human cancers, where they lead to enhanced expression of telomerase.

Reactivation or re-expression of telomerase is referred to be a widespread feature in human cancers, although the genetic basis remains poorly understood in many cancer types. Somatic mutations in the coding region of TERT (human telomerase reverse transcriptase) are infrequent in human tumours, but germline and somatic mutations in TERT promoter were recently found in a high percentage of human melanomas and human cancer cell lines1,2. Such mutations occurred in two hotspot positions, located  124 and  146 bp upstream from the ATG start site (  124 G4A and  146 G4A, C4T on opposite strand) and conferred enhanced TERT promoter activity1,2, by putatively generating a consensus binding site (GGAA) for ETS transcription factors within the TERT promoter region1,2. Our aim was to investigate whether the aforementioned TERT promoter mutations were present in cancer types other than melanoma, having for that matter screened 741 primary tumours from the thyroid, kidney, bladder, gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST), adrenal medulla (phaeochromocytomas) and central nervous system (CNS). Besides skin melanoma, we have also included ocular melanoma (not studied in the previous reports), benign lesions of the thyroid and skin and 58 human cancer-derived cell lines. Our results highlight TERT promoter mutations as frequent events in specific types of human cancers. Results TERT mutations in tumours and cell lines. Overall, TERT promoter mutations were found in 142 (19%) human tumour samples (Table 1; Fig. 1a) and 14 (24%) human cell lines (Fig. 1b; Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). The  124-bp mutation was the most frequent, being present in 99 cases, whereas the  146- bp mutation was present in 43 cases. The  124 G4A and  146 G4A mutations were found in a mutually exclusive fashion. Two tandem GG4AA mutations at positions  124/  125 and  138/  139 bp were observed in one cell line each (Supplementary Fig. S1 and Supplementary Table S1). TERT promoter mutations were not detected in normal thyroid tissue nor in benign lesions (nevi, thyroiditis, goitres and adenomas). No mutations were detected in 26 kidney cancers, 17 phaeochromocytomas and 36 GISTs. TERT mutations in melanoma. We have analysed both skin and ocular melanomas, a type of melanoma that was not previously studied1,2. TERT mutations were present in 16 out of 56 (29%) skin melanomas, but absent in the 25 ocular melanomas (Table 1). All the four skin melanoma-derived cell lines but none of the six ocular melanoma-derived cell lines harboured TERT mutations (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table S1). Ten out of 16 (63%) skin melanomas with TERT mutation also harboured the BRAFV600E mutation, whereas the BRAF mutation was present in 9 out of 38 (24%) melanomas without TERT mutation (P ¼ 0.01, Fisher’s exact test, two-sided) (Supplementary Fig. S2 and Supplementary Table S3). TERT mutations in CNS tumours. In CNS tumours, TERT promoter mutations were found in 43% (51/118) of all cases with an equal prevalence of both mutations (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S4). The frequency of TERT mutations was different according to the tumour histology and grade (Fig. 1c): although pilocytic astrocytomas (World Health Organization (WHO) grade 1) and diffuse astrocytoma (WHO grade 2) showed a lower frequency of mutations (8% and 15%, respectively), the most aggressive form, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; WHO grade 4), present the highest frequency of TERT mutations (62%). Oligodendrogliomas (WHO grade 2) and anaplastic oligodendrogliomas (WHO grade 3) also harboured a high frequency of TERT mutations (45% and 54%, respectively). The presence of TERT mutations was significantly associated with a higher mean age at diagnosis (Supplementary Table S5) in CNS patients as a whole (Po0.0001; Mann–Whitney test, twotailed) and also in GBM patients only (P ¼ 0.0247; Mann– Whitney test, two-tailed); in oligodendroglioma patients, we found the same trend, although not statistically significant (P ¼ 0.0709; Mann–Whitney test, two-tailed). In addition, we observed that, in a subset of 14 GBM (8 TERT wild-type tumours and 6 TERT-mutated tumours), the tumours with TERT mutations showed a trend to increased immunohistochemistry (IHC) expression of telomerase, although this difference was not statistically significant (P ¼ 0.4250; Mann–Whitney test, two-tailed) (Fig. 2). TERT mutations in thyroid cancer. We analysed a large series of follicular cell-derived thyroid samples including normal thyroid (n ¼ 27), benign (n ¼ 81) and malignant lesions (n ¼ 263) (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S6). TERT mutations were only detected in malignant tumours (10%) (Fig. 1d), namely in Table 1 | Prevalence of TERT promoter recurrent mutations in human cancers.

Within the group of PTC, TERT mutations were detected to be associated to the so-called conventional PTC (cPTC) (11%).The majority of TERT-mutated thyroid cancers harboured the  124 G4A mutation (22 out of 27 cases) (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Table S7). In thyroid cancer patients, TERT mutations were significantly associated with guarded prognosis features such as larger tumours (P ¼ 0.008; Mann–Whitney test, two-tailed), older patients (Po0.0001; Mann–Whitney test, two-tailed) and male gender (P ¼ 0.0312; Fisher’s exact test, two-sided) (Supplementary Table S5).

In bladder cancer, TERT mutations were frequently detected (48/82; 59%) both in lowgrade tumours (14/21; 67%) and high-grade tumours (34/61; 56%) (Table 1 and Fig. 1e; Supplementary Table S9). The  124 G4A mutation was present in 30 cases, whereas the  146 G4A was found in 18 cases. No association was found between the presence of the mutation and the age of the patients. No mutations were detected in 26 kidney cancers, 17 phaeochromocytoma and 36 GISTs (Supplementary Tables S10, S11 and S12, respectively). Discussion Recent findings have described that TERT promoter mutations arise as a novel mechanism of telomerase reactivation/expression in human cancers1,2. In this work, we report for the first time the presence of these mutations in different histotypes of thyroid cancer, and our results validate the findings reported by others in melanoma, bladder and gliomas1–3. Furthermore, we present for the first time evidence showing that TERT promoter mutations are significantly associated with increased TERT mRNA expression in thyroid cancers. We also found a trend for increased telomerase expression in cases of GBM harbouring TERT promoter mutations. In thyroid cancers, TERT mRNA was particularly high in cases harbouring both TERT and BRAF mutations. The location of these mutations in the TERT promoter, rather than the coding region of the gene, creating additional binding sites for transcription factors, represents also a novel mechanism of genetic activation in cancer. The frequency of TERT mutations we detected in skin melanomas is similar to that reported by Horn et al.1 in primary melanomas (33%), but lower than the frequency found by the same authors in metastatic melanomas (85%) and by Huang et al.2 in a series of 70 melanomas and short-term cultures1,2. In our series, we have analysed few metastatic melanomas that did not show a significantly higher percentage of TERT mutations. As our series is too small to allow a conclusion, it remains to be verified if there is an increased frequency of TERT mutations in metastatic melanomas, as suggested by previous reports1,2. We have confirmed, in skin melanomas, the significant association between TERT and BRAF mutations, as previously advanced by Horn et al.1, which we now also demonstrate in thyroid cancers. Interestingly, in benign nevi, which frequently harbour BRAF mutations, we did not detect TERT mutations. This finding, together with the high frequency of TERT mutations in metastatic melanomas1, suggests that, although BRAF mutations are thought to be an early event in melanoma genesis, TERT mutations may occur at a later stage. No TERT promoter mutations were found in ocular melanomas, which, at variance with skin melanomas, harbour GNAQ mutations instead of BRAF mutations4,5. Our results further support the assumption that ocular melanomas result from different etiopathogenic mechanism than skin melanomas5,6. Our data on CNS tumours indicate that TERT promoter mutations are frequent events in gliomas, particularly in GBM where the highest mutation frequency was found. It has been shown that TERT mutations conferred enhanced TERT promoter activity in vitro1,2; our findings fit with this assumption because we observed that GBM with TERT promoter mutations appear to display increased telomerase expression, despite the limited sensitivity of IHC and the low number of cases analysed. Our results are also in concordance with those of Lotsch et al.7 who reported that 60% of GBMs were positive for TERT mRNA and telomerase activity7. It will be interesting to assess whether the GBM positive for telomerase activity described by Lotsch et al.7 also harbour TERT promoter mutations. Our findings also indicate that TERT mutations are associated with older patients, in accordance with a recent report3. The high frequency of TERT mutations in CNS tumours, particularly in intermediate and high-grade tumours, opens a window for new approaches in the therapy of CNS tumours. In thyroid cancer, TERT mutations were only found in follicular cell-derived cancers (PTC, follicular thyroid carcinoma, poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma). No mutations were detected in medullary thyroid carcinomas, as described by Killela et al.3, nor in normal thyroid and benign lesions, such as goitre, adenomas or thyroiditis; this finding fits with previous studies that reported telomerase expression in malignant lesions and not in normal tissue or hyperplastic lesions8,9.

In cPTC, TERT mutations were associated with BRAF mutation, highlighting the coexistence of activation of BRAF and TERT, previously reported in melanoma1 (Supplementary Fig. S2). Our results reinforce the hypothesis of a link between BRAF activation and telomerase expression, which can be mediated by transcription factors binding to the newly created consensus binding sites, as previously advanced by Horn et al.1. Both in thyroid carcinoma and melanoma, it seems that a ‘background’ status of activated BRAF enhances the effects of TERT promoter mutation. Our results in TERT mRNA expression strengthen this assumption, showing, for the first time, an increased TERT expression in tumours harbouring BRAF and TERT mutation (Fig. 3). Further observational and mechanistic studies are needed to clarify these points. TERT alterations seem to constitute an early and frequent event in bladder cancer. These findings fit with the high prevalence of telomerase activity previously described in bladder tumours10. The recurrent hotspot mutations in TERT were advanced to be, in melanomas, induced by ultraviolet radiation2. Bladder is a target for several chemical carcinogens; it remains to be found whether TERT mutations can also result from the action of such agents. The identification of TERT mutations in urine may provide a biomarker for early diagnosis and monitoring of bladder cancer. No TERT mutations were detected in kidney cancers, nor in 17 phaeochromocytoma and 36 GISTs. The underlying reasons for the tissue specificity of TERT mutations remain to be clarified. We can hypothesize that TERT mutations can be present in two settings. As described by Killela et al.3, TERT mutations can be relevant in tissues with relative low rates of self-renewal, which fits with our findings in follicular cell-derived thyroid cancer and gliomas where they are associated with the older age of the patients. On the other hand, these mutations can also result from environmental factors such as ultraviolet radiation and chemical carcinogens as suggested by their high frequency in melanoma, bladder and tongue1–3. In summary, our data identify TERT mutations as common events in human cancers and support the assumption that TERT promoter mutations may be one of the mechanisms that underlies telomerase reactivation in several types of human tumours.  Introduction The telomere sequences at the chromosomal ends, composed of tandem repeats of TTAGGG, are protected by a number of molecules that constitute the capping Shelterin complex [1 ;  2]. The incomplete replication due to limitations of the process, called ‘end-replication problem’, results in shortening of telomeres in each successive mitotic cell division that eventually leads to replicative senescence referred to as the ‘Hayflick limit’ [3; 4 ;  5]. Maintenance of telomere repeat length is dependent on sustained expression of telomerase holoenzyme that adds de novo repeat units at the end of each replication cycle [ 6 ;  7]. Progressive attrition of telomeres is also defined as one of the hallmarks of aging of organisms [ 8 ;  9]. Cancer cells, characteristically, acquire infinite capability to divide through maintenance of telomeres by sustained expression of telomerase or in its absence by an alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) mechanism [ 10; 11; 12; 13; 14 ;  15••].  Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase that together with a RNA component, TERC, maintains genomic integrity by telomere elongation [ 16]. Though TERT and TERC are sufficient for in vitro telomerase activity, the in vivo telomerase functioning requires additional components that associate with TERT and TERC, to form the holoenzyme [ 17 ;  18]. Those include dyskerin (DKC), NOP10 ribonucleoprotein (NOP10), GAR1 ribonucleoprotein homolog (yeast) (GAR1), NHP2 ribonucleoprotein (NHP2), reptin and pontin [ 11; 19; 20; 21 ;  22].  Deregulation of telomerase has been shown to be a ubiquitous feature in human cancers with over 90% of cancers showing an upregulation of the enzyme [11; 23 ;  24]. The telomerase activity is dependent on a number of factors, regulated at various stages, which include gene transcription, mRNA splicing, maturation and modifications of TERT and TERC, transport and localization of those components and assembly of active telomerase ribonucleoprotein to telomeres [ 4; 5; 16; 20; 21; 25; 26 ;  27]. The catalytic component TERT acts as a determinant of telomerase activity and its transcription is repressed in most of the somatic cells with the exception of proliferative cells of self-renewing tissues [ 28; 29 ;  30]. An increased expression of TERT has been consistently demonstrated to be a fundamental requirement for cellular transformation [ 4; 31; 32; 33; 34• ;  35].  The mechanism of TERT upregulation in cancers had been attributed to several mechanisms including epigenetic deregulation as well as genetic amplification of the locus containing TERT gene [ 36 ;  37]. In the absence of any evidence of a definite mechanism, the telomerase activity in tumor cells has been attributed to the assumption of stem cells being the progenitors in all cancers [38]. The normal stem cells in self-renewing tissues retain telomerase throughout lifetime replication thus abrogating a requirement for a positive selection [6]. The recently discovered TERT promoter mutations add a new dimension to the acquisition of telomerase activity in human cancers. In this review we provide an overview and possible implications of the newly discovered mutations in the promoter of the TERT gene in a wide range of cancers.  Structure and regulation of the TERT promoter The human TERT gene is located on chromosome 5p15.33 and the promoter region of the gene is considered to be the most important regulatory element for telomerase expression. The TERT promoter contains binding motifs for several factors that regulate the gene transcription and distinctly lacks a TATA box or a similar sequence [ 39; 40; 41; 42 ;  43]. The core promoter region consists of 260 base pairs with several transcription-factor binding sites that include E-boxes where c-Myc has been confirmed to bind and activate the transcription [ 44; 45; 46; 47 ;  48]. BRCA1 in conjunction with N-Myc interacting protein (Nmi) forms a complex with c-Myc and inhibits TERT promoter activity, that property is lost in some mutant forms of BRCA1 [ 49]. Other sequence elements in TERT promoter include GC-boxes, which are binding sites for zinc finger transcription factor, Sp1 [ 4 ;  45]. Transcription of the TERT gene is also regulated by various hormones, cytokines and oncogenes [ 45]. Several repressors of the TERT transcription are also known. p53 has been shown to downregulate TERT transcription in a Sp1-dependent manner [ 50]. Ets transcription factors that comprise over 30 members are prominently associated with telomerase activation [ 42 ;  51]. Ets2 has been shown to form a complex with c-Myc in a breast cancer cell line [ 44 ;  51]. Ets transcription factors are also shown to be stimulated by oncogenes EGF, Her2/Nez, Ras and Raf [ 52 ;  53]. The activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressors are known to account for cellular immortalization through induction of TERT transcription [ 54]. The high GC content around the transcription start site of the TERT promoter confers epigenetic regulation through methylation and chromatin remodeling [ 37 ;  55].  TERT promoter mutations in human cancers A discovery of a high-penetrant disease-segregating causal germline mutation in a melanoma family and highly specific and recurrent somatic mutations in tumors from unrelated patients in the TERT promoter has likely provided a definite mechanism for cancer-specific TERT activation [ 56•• ;  57••]. Two independent studies using diverse approaches discovered non-coding mutations, mainly at two residues, within the core promoter region of the TERT gene. One study was based on the identification of a causal gene mutation in a large melanoma pedigree where affected individuals presented a severe form of the disease with an early age of onset. The linkage analysis identified a 2.2 megabase telomeric region on chromosome 5p that included TERT along with more than 80 other genes [ 56••]. Sequencing of the entire stretch of DNA region in the family resulted in identification of a disease segregating A > C (T > G) single base change at −57 bp (Chr 5: 1,295,161 hg19 coordinate) from ATG start site. The germline mutation was present in affected and absent in unaffected individuals in the family with the exception of one. Subsequent screening of cell lines derived from melanoma metastases from unrelated patients led to the detection of recurrent and mutually exclusive somatic mutations at two residues −124 and −146 from the ATG start site in the TERT promoter [ 56••]. Serendipitously, an independent study using a whole genome sequencing approach also reported the recurrent somatic TERT promoter mutations at the same positions [ 57••]. Other mutations detected in TERT promoter included the CC > TT tandem mutations at −124/−125 and −138/−139 bp from ATG start site. The germline and somatic mutations in the non-coding part of the TERT gene were defined by common salient features. One of the underlying features included a de novo creation of CCGGAA/T general binding motifs for E-twenty six/ternary complex factors (Ets/TCF) transcription factors, which differed from pre-existing GGAA/T Ets binding sites within the TERT promoter ( Figure 1). The somatic mutations at both positions being C > T and the additional detection of CC > TT tandem mutations in a proportion of tumors augmented the evidence for the UV-origin of tumor specific nucleotide changes in melanoma as shown previously in studies based on whole genome sequencing [58•]. Interestingly, the mutations detected in the TERT promoter in melanoma were more frequent than those in the BRAF gene.  Schematic representation of a part of the TERT promoter that contains residues, ... Figure 1.  Schematic representation of a part of the TERT promoter that contains residues, which are affected by a germline mutation in a melanoma family at the position −57 bp and recurrent somatic mutations at the positions −124 and −146 bp from the ATG start site. The mutations create CCGGAA/T binding motif for Ets/TCF transcription factors that results in an increased TERT expression. Pre-existing binding sites for other transcriptions factors are shown above the sequence. Figure options It was also observed that the TERT promoter mutations tend to occur more often than expected by chance in tumors with either BRAF mutations (odds ratio [OR] 3.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3–8.2) or with concomitant alterations in both BRAF and CDKN2A (OR 5.6, 95% CI 2.4–13.8) [ 56••]. BRAF mutations, due to occurrence and role in development of melanocytic nevi, are considered as the driver genetic lesions in melanoma [ 56••; 59• ;  60]. The loss of CDKN2A has been suggested to play a role in the escape of melanocytes from BRAF induced senescence [61]. The acquisition of TERT promoter mutations can be hypothesized to facilitate stabilization of the transformed genome through reversal of telomeric loss. Most melanocytic nevi carry BRAF mutations, whereas TERT promoter mutations and CDKN2A alterations are detected only in primary melanoma and beyond [ 56•• ;  62].  Bonafide of newly discovered non-coding mutations in the TERT promoter was established by the detection in cancers other than melanoma [ 63••]. The frequency of the mutations seems to vary between cancer types (Table 1). The highest frequencies of the TERT promoter mutations have so far been reported, besides melanoma, in pleomorphic dermal sarcoma, myxoid liposarcoma, glioma, urothelial cell carcinoma of bladder, basal and squamous cell carcinoma of skin, liver cancer and others [ 63••; 64; 65; 66; 67; 68; 69; 70; 71; 72; 73; 74; 75 ;  76]. The mutations occur in other cancer types as well, albeit, at low frequencies [ 63•• ;  67]. Based on the prevalence in different cancer types it has been hypothesized that the TERT promoter mutations mainly occur in tumors that are derived from tissues with low rates of self-renewal [ 63•• ;  77]. Unlike melanoma and other skin related malignancies, no tumor from the cancers affecting internal organs carried CC > TT tandem mutations in the TERT promoter with the exception of that at the positions −138/−139 bp from ATG start site in bladder cancer. The tandem mutation reported so far in 4 of the 1231 bladder tumors could also be generated by a single-base mutation at −138 bp as the base change at −139 bp has been reported as a rare polymorphism represented by rs35550267 [ 56••; 65 ;  66]. The differences in mutational pattern in cancer types are known to reflect etiological divergences and the C > T base change in tumors can also be attributed to APOBEC cytidine deaminase expression in cancer development [ 78•• ;  79••].

Table options Functional aspects of TERT promoter mutations The high recurrence, specificity and gain of function support that the non-coding TERT promoter mutations are driver rather than passenger events in cancer development. The functional relevance of the mutations was indicated by the basic reporter assays that showed 2–4-fold increased promoter activity [ 56••; 57•• ;  80••]. Tumors from thyroid cancers, primary glioma, malignant pleural mesothelioma and liver cancers with TERT promoter mutations were associated with higher gene expression than those without mutations [ 67; 69; 72 ;  74]. Though limited at the moment, the available data do indicate a tendency of the TERT promoter mutations being present in specific clinical and phenotypic subtypes and appear to be associated with adversarial forms of the disease. While in medulloblastomas the TERT promoter mutations were inversely associated with increased OTX2 expression; in primary adult glioma, the mutations occurred mainly in conjunction with EGFR amplification [ 69]. Glioma patients with TERT promoter mutations showed an association with poorer survival than patients without mutations; in thyroid cancer, mutations are reportedly more frequent in advanced thyroid cancers than in papillary thyroid cancers [ 63••; 70 ;  71].  The studies on bladder cancer consistently showed that TERT promoter mutations are the most frequent lesions with even distribution across all stages and grades [ 65; 66 ;  80••]. Intriguingly, an observed interaction has raised a possibility of eventual use of the TERT promoter mutations in conjunction with a common polymorphism within the sequence as biomarkers in bladder cancer. The data from bladder cancer showed that the variant allele of a common polymorphism at −245 bp from ATG start site in the TERT promoter acts as a modifier of the effect of TERT promoter mutations on patient survival and disease recurrence [ 80••]. Bladder cancer patients with TERT promoter mutations in tumors showed almost two-fold decreased survival and increased disease recurrence in the absence but not in the presence of the variant allele for the rs2853669 polymorphism [ 80••]. Mechanistic support for the observation was provided by the fact that mutations result in de novo creation of Ets/TCF binding motifs; the variant allele of the rs2853669 polymorphism, on the contrary, disrupts a preexisting non-canonical Ets2 binding site in the proximal region of the TERT promoter, adjacent to an E-box [ 44].  The occurrence of highly specific TERT promoter mutations indicates a strong selection pressure for the gene over-expression on path to cellular transformation. Increased telomerase production has been demonstrated to promote cancer progression in an animal model [ 81•]. The effect of the promoter mutations on TERT expression can be tenable only in the presence of Ets/TCF transcription factors that can specifically bind to the de novo sites created by the mutations. Some of the Ets/TCF transcription factors are downstream targets of MAPK pathway, where BRAF is a prominent intermediate [ 82; 83 ;  84]. Whether in melanoma activated BRAF is a driving force in selection of TERT promoter mutations remains to be determined. Nevertheless, expression of Ets transcription factors is ubiquitous in melanoma and other cancers [ 85 ;  86].  Many studies have stressed the function of the TERT gene beyond its role in maintenance of the telomere; therefore the mutations in the TERT promoter can affect non-canonical processes associated with TERT [ 87; 88; 89; 90 ;  91]. TERT acts as a modulator of Wnt-b-catenin signaling pathway and induces stem cell characteristics in glioma; TERT also regulates expression of NF-kB, a master regulator of inflammation [ 92•; 93 ;  94]. TERT was shown to be important for proliferation of p53-negative cells through ATR mediated stabilization of ETV1, which binds downstream of the transcriptional start site [95]. Other non-canonical functions of TERT include enhanced cell proliferation, decreased apoptosis, regulation of DNA damage responses, chromatin state and increased cellular proliferation life span [ 96; 97 ;  98]. The effect of the mutations beyond transcription also remains a probability. The human TERT promoter contains G-rich sequence and has potential for G-quadruplex formation that can potentially be targeted to regulate gene transcription [ 99]. G-quadruplexes have been also implicated in inhibition of telomerase and control of gene expression [100].  Conceptual advancement and therapeutic possibilities The TERT promoter mutations are thought to represent a conceptual advancement in the sense that those instead of altering an encoded protein modulate transcriptional regulation and represent first evidence of driver alterations in so called ‘dark matter’ of the human genome [ 101• ;  102]. A host of germline variants discovered through genome wide association studies contribute to the susceptibility of various diseases through transcriptional deregulation [103]. While TERT promoter mutations represent novel findings in human cancer, alterations in components associated with telomerase assembly, telomere protection or telomere recruitment are known to impact stem cell function and lifespan in mammals through various disorders [ 104 ;  105].  Several strategies of therapeutic telomerase inhibition including small molecular inhibitors, immunotherapy, gene therapy, telomere and telomerase-proteins in different cancers have entered clinical trial [106]. It will be interesting to see if the TERT promoter mutations, that increase gene expression, influence the current on-going research on targeted therapeutics or if the use of telomerase inhibitors in conjunction with kinase inhibitors like vemurafenib or similar small molecules in melanoma can alleviate recurrent resistance [ 107]. Abstract Cell immortalization has been considered for a long time as a classic hallmark of cancer cells. Besides telomerase reactivation, such immortalization could be due to telomere maintenance through the “alternative mechanism of telomere lengthening” (ALT) but the mechanisms underlying both forms of reactivation remained elusive. Mutations in the coding region of telomerase gene are very rare in the cancer setting, despite being associated with some degenerative diseases. Recently, mutations in telomerase (TERT) gene promoter were found in sporadic and familial melanoma and subsequently in several cancer models, notably in gliomas, thyroid cancer and bladder cancer. The importance of these findings has been reinforced by the association of TERT mutations in some cancer types with tumour aggressiveness and patient survival. In the first part of this review, we summarize the data on the biology of telomeres and telomerase, available methodological approaches and non-neoplastic diseases associatedwith telomere dysfunction. In the second part, we review the information on telomerase expression and genetic alterations in the most relevant types of cancer (skin, thyroid, bladder and central nervous system) on record, and discuss the value of telomerase as a new biomarker with impact on the prognosis and survival of the patients and as a putative therapeutic target. Keywords Telomerase . TERT . Promoter . Mutations . Biomarker . Cancer Telomeres and telomerase in germinative and somatic tissues Normal somatic cells are not immortal and dispose of a predetermined limited number of divisions, a phenomenon known as the Hayflick limit. In 1961, Leonard Hayflick demonstrated that in cell cultures, a population of normal human fetal cells could divide around 40 to 60 times before entering into senescence [44]. At the time, the limited replication potential of somatic cells was not fully understood. Years later, the pioneering research of Nobel Prize winners Elizabeth Blackburn, Jack Szostak and Carolyn Greider identified a refined mechanism by which telomeres are shortened at each round of cell division creating a replication limit [9, 36, 116]. Currently, it is well established that telomeres are João Vinagre, Vasco Pinto and Ricardo Celestino contributed equally to the manuscript. J. Vinagre : V. Pinto : R. Celestino : M. Reis : H.

The main function of telomeres is to preserve chromosome integrity and genome stability by preventing the chromosome end from degradation [41, 85]. At each cell division, the telomeric DNA is diminished and telomeres become progressively shorter. Eventually, this loss leads to a stop in cell division that forces cell senescence or cell death. This telomere-based mechanismhas been proposed to serve as the “clock” that controls the number of times each cell can divide [41, 85]. In order to achieve immortalization, cells need to overcome the aforementioned barrier. There are two major pathways cells use for maintain telomere lengthening; they either reactivate telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein polymerase, which elongates telomeres by adding hexameric 5′-TTAGGG-3′ tandem repeats to the chromosomal ends at the ends, or take advantage of a non-telomerase-dependent (alternative) mechanism, known as ALT [21, 59]. Reactivation of telomerase is present in up to 90 % of human cancers, and it allows proliferative cancer cells to maintain telomere length [65]. The remaining 10 to 15 % of human cancers do not have detectable telomerase activity, and a subset of such cases maintain telomere length relying on the ALT mechanism [21]. Heaphy and colleagues performed a comprehensive survey on ALT phenotype in 6,110 primary tumours from 94 different cancer subtypes and observed the presence of ALT in 3.7 % of all tumour specimens but its absence in all benign neoplasms and normal tissues [46]. In this study, the ALT phenotype was identified for the first time in medulloblastoma, oligodendroglioma, schwannoma and glioblastoma [46]. Later on, Heaphy and colleagues demonstrated that ATRX or DAXX mutations are closely associated with the development of ALT in pancreatic endocrine tumours whereas ATRX mutations lead to ALT phenotype in cancers of the central nervous system [45]. Benign neoplasms and normal somatic cells apparently lack telomerase activity but a high level of telomerase activity can be detected in germ cells and in stem cells of selfrenewing tissues [41]. Some putative stem cells, such as the main cells of thyroid solid cell nests, also express telomerase, as we have previously reported [95, 101]. Most cells that need that to escape telomere shortening rely on the reactivation of telomerase. The telomerase complex comprises several components, the most important being the telomerase RNA component (TERC), the telomerase reverse transcriptase catalytic subunit (TERT) and dyskerin (DKC1 gene) [22, 83, 87]. It was shown in telomerase-negative cells, such as differentiated epithelial cells or human fibroblasts [33], that TERT is the only component necessary to restore the activity of the telomerase complex. The TERT gene is located on chromosome 5 and includes 16 exons that span a 35-kb region. The core promoter of telomerase includes 330 base pairs upstream of the start site, is located in a GC-rich region and contains transcript sites/consensus for transcription elements, indicating a high level of regulation by multiple factors [23] at transcriptional and/or post-transcriptional level [22]. Methods to evaluate telomeres length and telomerase activity As mentioned above, telomere length is maintained and higher levels of telomerase activity can be detected in cancer cells than in normal somatic cells. The interest in the detection of telomerase activity and/or in telomere length measurement has been increasing since it can represent a powerful tool for the diagnosis of telomerase-related diseases as well as for the understanding of cancer etiopathogenesis and, hopefully, for improving cancer treatment. In order to evaluate the two aforementioned features, several methods and approaches to measure telomere length, telomerase messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and telomerase enzymatic activity have been developed [113]. Herein, we merely provide a summary of the methods available; for a more detailed review, the reader is referred to references [46] and [115]. The traditional telomere restriction fragment (TRF) analysis measures the average length of all telomeres present in a cell population and is the most used technique for evaluating telomere length [4]. Based on Southern blotting, TRF involves the use of restriction enzymes to digest genomic DNA and a hybridization step with a telomeric probe [60]. Additional techniques available include: STELA (single telomere elongation length analysis), a very accurate method that can only be used on a sample with a limited number of cells; quantitative PCR, less time consuming but less accurate [7]; Q-FISH (quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization) which allows specific measurement of chromosome ends with high resolution [20]; and, finally, Flow FISH, a very accurate method that evaluates cells in suspension [5]. The detection of telomerase is mainly based on assays that evaluate telomerase enzymatic activity [64, 129]. Refinement of these techniques led to a sensitive technique, the telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP). TRAP assay includes the preparation of a protein extract by cell lysis and the addition of a labelled oligonucleotide substrate along with dNTPs, followed by PCR. In the first step of the reaction, if telomerase is active in the extract, it adds a number of telomeric repeats onto the 3′ end of a labelled substrate oligonucleotide; in the second step, the extended products are amplified by PCR using primers, which generates a ladder of products with 6-base increments starting at 50 nucleotides: 50, 56, 62, 68, etc. [59]. TRAP is the most used technique to evaluate telomerase activity due to its high sensitivity but it also has some limitations: it is very time consuming and can generate false-negative results if the PCR step fails [64]. Recent improvements in the TRAP technique avoid the use 120 Virchows Arch (2014) 465:119–133 of radioactive nucleotides [115]; other efforts have been made to refine the protocol in an attempt to still improve its sensitivity and to increase its reliability [113, 129]. Telomerase in degenerative diseases Three human diseases—dyskeratosis congenita (DC), aplastic anaemia (AA) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)—are associated to mutations in genes that code for the telomerase components, either TERC or TERT, as well for the following telomerase-associated proteins: DKC1, telomerase Cajal body protein 1, TCAB1 (WRP53 gene), NOLA2 protein (NHP2 gene) and NOP10 protein (NOLA3 gene) [79]. Additionally, one of the six proteins that compose the shelterin complex— TERF1-interacting nuclear factor 2 (TIN2 gene)—has also been associated with autosomal-dominant DC, Hoyeraal Hreidarsson syndrome, Revesz syndrome and AA. Furthermore, some alterations affect proteins which do not have a direct impact on telomerase but concern the telomere such the telomere maintenance complex component 1 protein (CTC1 gene) that is associated to Coats plus syndrome, which is a formof cerebroretinalmicroangiopathy with calcifications and cysts. Finally, mutations of the regulator of telomere elongation helicase 1 (RTEL1 gene) have been identified in patients with severe autosomal recessive DC [35] (Table 1). DC is a rare inherited disorder characterized by a typical triad of clinical manifestations: skin hyperpigmentation, oral leukoplakia and nail dystrophy [26]. The majority of cases (>80 %) occur in children and are diagnosed usually about the age of ten when the children start presenting bone marrow failure together with the previously described clinical triad. Other symptoms that include indicators of premature ageing, such as pulmonary diseases, dental abnormalities and alopecia, are present in 15–25 % of the cases [79]. Within the DC spectrum, there is the Hoyeraal Hreidarsson syndrome, a multisystemic disorder characterized by mental retardation, microcephaly, intrauterine growth retardation, cerebellar hypoplasia, immunodeficiency and AA [51]. The Revesz syndrome that is characterized by bilateral exudative retinopathy, bone-marrow hypoplasia, nail dystrophy, fine hair, cerebellar hypoplasia and growth retardation is also present in the DC disease spectrum [108]. DC is a genetically heterogeneous disease; to date, there are nine genes associated with DC and all of them contribute to telomere maintenance/protection or telomerase function, thus explaining the excessively short telomeres of DC patients. The group of DC genes encompasses the core telomerase component TERT and TERC and the telomerase complex proteins coded by DKC1, WRAP53, NOP10 and NHP2 genes. Other genes include the shelterin complex TIN2 gene, CTC1 and RTEL1 genes [35] (Table 1). AA is a rare and severe bone marrow disorder characterized by hypocelullar bone marrow and low blood cell counts [109]. Similarly to DC, the cases of AA arise from scarcity of haematopoietic progenitor and stem cells [17]. Since patients have shorter telomeres than matched controls, telomerase components constitute an attractive target for genetic screening. Mutations have been detected in the coding sequence of telomerase core components TERT and TERC (Table 1). Occasionally, AA can develop slowly and appear as an atypical form of DC due to bone marrow failure over time [31]. IPF is a rapidly progressive disorder with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and different degrees of penetrance. The symptoms that characterize the disease are chronic cough and shortness of breath due to fibrotic lesions and scarring of the lungs [40]. IPF can co-exist in patients with AA and DC [35]. Like in the aforementioned disorders, IPF patients also have shorter telomeres than age-matched controls [17]. TERT and TERC telomerase component mutations have been found in familial forms of IPF [107].

Most of them are haematological disorders, such as myelodysplatic syndrome and paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria [35]. In cases of myelodysplastic syndrome, mutations are considered an extremely rare event and were described in TERC coding region and its promoter [17]. The same mutation, which ablates a transcription factor binding site in the TERC promoter, has also been detected in a case of paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria [17]. Additional information regarding mutations in degenerative disorders is summarized in Table 1, and further information can be retrieved on the telomerase disease database (http://telomerase.asu.edu/). Telomerase promoter mutations and cancer It has been known for 20 years that high levels of telomerase activity can be detected in cancer cells [59]; this contrasts with the fact that mutations affecting the telomerase coding region appear to be very uncommon in cancer [4]. A rare example of neoplasia presenting mutations in the coding region of telomerase is acute myeloid leukaemia in which few TERT mutations have been identified [17]. However, it should be taken into account that this form of leukaemia can arise from AA and myelodysplatic syndromes in which TERT mutations have been detected [17]. Published simultaneously in the beginning of 2013, two different studies reported mutations in the promoter of the telomerase gene inmelanoma [50, 53].We and others reported the presence of recurrent somatic mutations in the telomerase promoter in cancers of the central nervous system (43–51 %), bladder (59–66 %), hepatocellular carcinoma (59 %), thyroid (follicular cell-derived tumours) (10 %), skin (melanoma, 29– 73 %) and tumours originated from tissues with relatively low rates of self-renewal [58, 75, 88, 121]. Additionally, other studies reported the association of telomerase promoter mutations to other types of tumours, including atypical fibroxantoma (93 %), pleomorphic dermal sarcoma (76 %) [39], bladder cancer (65 %) [1, 54], basal cell carcinoma (78 %), squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (50 %) [110] and clear cell carcinoma of the ovary [124]. In Tables 2 and 3, we summarize the frequency of TERT promoter mutations in human cancers with a high percentage of mutations and in human cancers with absent or low frequency of TERT promoter mutations, respectively. The in vitro biological assessment of the functional consequence of these mutations, studied by promoter luciferase assay, revealed that their presence results in a two to fourfold increase in telomerase expression [50, 53]. Since previously published studies reported high levels of TERT expression in the set of tumours with TERT promoter mutations [70, 78, 111], it is likely that such alterations may represent one of the missing links between telomerase gene regulation/ reactivation. Telomerase promoter mutations in skin cancers Telomerase activity has been reported in normal skin by some authors [43, 118, 119] while other authors suggest that in normal skin, it is a rare event [52, 91]. Its activation in the epidermis may be related with the need for cell proliferation and damage repair [11]. The shortening of telomeres, on the other hand, is believed to provide a barrier for epidermal cell proliferation (i.e. cancer) [11]. Telomerase activity has been reported in cutaneous melanomas, using the TRAP assay, with increasing values from normal skin to benign nevi and to dysplastic nevi and finally to melanoma [29]. An association between increased telomerase activity and worse prognostic features, namely, ulceration, vascular invasion, mitotic rate and Breslow thickness has been described in melanoma [18, 32, 81, 91, 100]. Furthermore, higher telomerase activity has also been associated with higher proliferation rate and early metastasis [100, 104]. The suppression of telomerase activity in melanoma cell lines induced cellular differentiation and reduced the metastatic ability [6, 30]. Longer telomere length has been linked with a higher number of nevi per patient and an increased risk for cutaneous melanoma development [2, 8, 42, 86]. It was proposed that shorter telomere length in nevi limits proliferation and promotes senescence, protecting against malignant transformation [41, 86]. At variance with the aforementioned reports, Burke and colleagues suggested that telomere length can also be influenced by CDKN2A mutational status (a high-risk melanoma susceptibility gene), sun exposure and pigmentation phenotype and therefore cannot be considered a biomarker to predict melanoma risk per se [12]. Two seminal papers reported high frequency of TERT promoter mutations in familial and sporadic melanoma [50, 53]. In the study from Horn and colleagues, a melanomaprone family was investigated through linkage and NGS and a germ-line disease-segregating mutation was identified in the telomerase promoter [50]. Further confirmation was obtained from the same group in a series of cell lines derived from metastatic melanomas, respective metastases and matched primary melanomas that revealed a higher frequency of the mutations in the metastases (74, 85 and 33 %, respectively) [50]. Huang and colleagues took a different approach, data mining of whole genome sequencing data, publicly available. They detected the presence of promoter mutations in 89 % of melanoma cases [53]. The mutations clustered mostly, but not exclusively, in two hotspots that are located at −146 and 122 Virchows Arch (2014) 465:119–133 −124 bps distance upstream of the start site ATG [53]. The detected mutations were cytidine to thymidine transitions at a dipyrimidine motif indicating a putative ultraviolet lightinduced damage signature. These mutations generate a new Table 2 Human cancers with high frequency (>5 %) of TERT promoter mutations Cancer type Number of mutations (%) Range (%) References Nervous system Astrocytoma (n=597) 96 (16) (7.7–25) [3, 57, 58, 63, 121] Glioblastoma (n=1103) 733 (66) (28–84) [3, 10, 57, 58, 77, 89, 121] Medulloblastoma (n=700) 154 (22) (19–42) [58, 63, 71, 102] Oligoastrocytoma (n=263) 116 (44) (25–53) [3, 57, 58, 63] Oligodendroglioma (n=318) 233 (73) (45–79) [3, 57, 58, 63, 121] Other tumours (n=792) 45 (5.7) (0–28) [34, 58, 63] Digestive system Gallbladder carcinoma (n=164) 14 (8.5) (0–9.1) [58, 98] Hepatocellular carcinoma (n=366) 206 (56) (44–59) [58, 88] Endocrine System Thyroid cancer Follicular carcinoma (n=207) 39 (19) (14–36) [74–76, 80, 121] Papillary carcinoma (n=1128) 132 (12) (7.5–25) [66, 74–76, 80, 121] Poorly differentiated carcinomas (n=97) 42 (43) (29–52) [66, 75, 80, 121] Anaplastic carcinoma (n=130) 57 (44) (33–50) [66, 74, 75, 80, 121] Hürthle cell carcinoma (n=61) 4 (6.6) (0–16) [66, 80, 121] Eye Conjunctival melanoma (n=42) 12 (29) (0–32) [38, 121] Head and neck Laryngeal carcinoma (n=235) 64 (27) - [97] Reproductive system Endometrial carcinoma (n=19) 2 (11) [58] Ovarian cancer Clear cell carcinoma (n=245) 39 (16) (16–17) [58, 124] Skin Basal cell carcinoma (n=270) 125 (46) (39–74) [37, 94, 110] Cutaneous melanoma (n=591) 215 (36) (12–71) [27, 47, 50, 53, 69, 94, 121] Mucosal melanoma (n=53) 7 (13) [27] Metastatic melanoma (n=92) 72 (78) (67–85) [27, 50] Squamous cell carcinoma (n=76) 32 (42) (9.1–50) [37, 58, 110] Soft tissue and pleura Atypical fibroxanthomas (n=27) 25 (93) [39] Chondrosarcoma (n=2) 1 (50) [58] Fibrosarcoma (n=3) 1 (33) [58] Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour (n=38) 2(5.3) (0–6) [58, 62] Malignant pleural mesothelioma (n=71) 8 (11) [117] Myxoid liposarcoma (n=63) 48 (76) (74–79) [58, 62] Pleomorphic dermal sarcoma (n=34) 26 (76) [39] Solitary fibrous tumour (n=41) 6 (15) (13–20) [58, 62] Kidney and urinary tract Bladder carcinoma (n=1447) 1028 (71) (47–85) [1, 54, 58, 77, 99, 121, 125] Renal cell carcinoma (n=159) 12(7.5) (0–9.2) [121, 123, 125] Renal pelvic carcinoma (n=16) 10 (63) (60–64) [123, 125] Transitional carcinoma of the ureter (n=9) 1(11) [123] Virchows Arch (2014) 465:119–133 123 Table 3 Human cancers with absent or very low frequency of TERT promoter mutations Cancer type Number of mutations (%) Range (%) References Breast Breast carcinoma (n=88) 0 – [58] Nervous system Spinal ependymoma (n=9) 0 – [58] Digestive system Colorectal adenocarcinoma (n=22) 0 – [58] Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (n=12) 0 – [58] Gastrointestinal stromal tumour (n=45) 0 – [58, 121] Gastric carcinoma (n=468) 2 (0.43) – [73, 98] Hepatoblastoma (n=3) 0 – [58] Pancreatic acinar carcinoma (n=25) 0 – [58] Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (n=24) 0 – [58] Pancreatic endocrine tumour (n=68) 0 – [58] Endocrine system Medullary thyroid carcinoma (n=158) 0 – [58, 74, 75, 80, 121] Phaeochromocytoma (n=17) 0 – [121] Eye Ocular melanoma (n=25) 0 – [121] Uveal melanoma (n=118) 1 (0.85) (0–2.0) [25, 38, 121] Head and neck Esophageal adenocarcinoma (n=90) 0 – [120] Esthesioneuroblastoma (n=11) 0 – [58] Squamous cell carcinoma (n=405) 17 (4.2) (0–17) [50, 58, 128] Haematopoietic system Acute myeloid leukaemia (n=48) 0 – [58] Chronic lymphoid leukaemia (n=15) 0 – [58] Chronic myeloid leukaemia (n=6) 0 – [58] Reproductive system Ovarian cancer Endometrioid carcinoma (n=43) 0 – [124] High-grade serous carcinoma (n=80) 0 – [124] Low-grade serous carcinoma (n=41) 2 (4.9) (3.3–13) [58, 124] Prostate carcinoma (n=47) 0 – [58, 125] Testicular carcinoma (n=17) 0 – [125] Uterine cervix cancer Endocervical adenocarcinoma (n=25) 0 – [124] Squamous cell carcinoma (n=75) 3 (4.0) (3.7–4.5) [58, 124] Uterine corpus cancer Endometrioid carcinoma (n=24) 0 – [124] Leiomyosarcoma (n=22) 0 – [124] Serous carcinoma (n=12) 0 – [124] Soft tissues and pleura Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (n=7) 0 – [58] Alveolar soft part sarcoma (n=6) 0 – [62] Angiosarcoma (n=9) 0 – [62] Cholangiosarcoma (n=28) 0 – [58] Clear cell sarcoma (n=5) 0 – [62] Central/conventional chondrosarcoma (n=9) 0 – [58] Dedifferentiated liposarcoma (n=61) 0 – [62] 124 Virchows Arch (2014) 465:119–133 binding consensus for ETS/TCFs transcription factors (CCGG AA) [50, 53]. Moreover, it was demonstrated in vitro by luciferase assay that the presence of these mutations lead to a two to fourfold increase of the TERT promoter activity [54]. TERT promoter mutations were not detected in nevi [121] but in 13%of mucosalmelanomas [27]. In primary cutaneous melanomas, TERT promoter mutations were found to be associated with BRAF V600E mutations, worse prognostic features and shorter disease free and overall survival [94, 121]. In ocular melanomas, TERT promoter mutations were described in 0 to 32 % of conjunctival melanomas [25, 121]. Mutations were not detected in uveal melanomas [121]. At variance with the aforementioned data, Dono and colleagues observed a case of uveal melanoma harbouring a TERT promoter mutation that co-existed with GNA11 and EIF1AX mutations [25]. TERT promoter mutations are frequent in non-melanoma skin cancer, ranging from 39 to 74 % in sporadic basal cell carcinomas (BCC) [37, 94, 110] and present in up to 50 % of cases of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) [37, 110].Telomerase activity has been detected in BCC using TRAP assay both in tumour and tumour-free margins, varying between 20 and 100 %, with less activity in the latter [29]. In the tumour-free margins, telomerase activity was found to be more prevalent in sun-exposed skin [105, 119]. In SCC, the data are scarce: Ueda and colleagues found telomerase activity in 100%of the cases of a small series (n=8) [119]. Few studies have examined the association between telomere length and skin cancer [2]. Some studies found no significant association between telomere length in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) and risk of non-melanoma skin cancer, either in BCC (two independent sets) [68] or in SCC [42, 68]. In contrast, other authors found that longer telomeres in PBL are protective for BCC [2, 86] and SCC [2]. Telomere length has also been evaluated by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) showing that higher telomere length in BCC is significantly higher than in SCC [93]. Telomerase promoter mutations in thyroid carcinomas Thyroid tissue is a conditionally renewing tissue that proliferates rarely in adult life. In line with this, telomerase activity in normal thyroid samples is almost absent, being detected in less than 7%of cases [16, 114]. On the other hand, telomerase activity was consistently reported in a specific population of thyroid cells—the solid cell nests (SCNs) which are considered to represent embryonic remnants of the ultimobranchial body [95, 101]. Thyroid carcinomas apparently display less frequent telomerase activation than most human carcinomas. Awide range of frequencies have been reported [16]; in average, it seems that two thirds of thyroid carcinomas display telomerase activation that is more frequent in the undifferentiated (anaplastic) than in differentiated carcinomas [16]. When the results obtained by several authors are combined, telomerase activity occurs in 48 % of papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC) and 71 % of follicular thyroid carcinomas (FTC). A TERT copy number gain was described in familial PTC [14], but this finding was not confirmed in another series [55]. A recent study by Capezzone and colleagues reported telomerase activity in most sporadic and familialmalignant thyroid tumours as well as in some adenomas [15]. Telomerase activity was not observed in hyperplastic nodules or in normal thyroid tissue from patients with sporadic PTC [15]. In summary, the aforementioned findings suggest that telomerase activity may be associated with a more aggressive clinical behaviour of thyroid tumours. Recently, somatic mutations in the promoter region of TERT were reported in thyroid tumours [66, 74, 75, 121]. In a large series of 469 follicular cell-derived thyroid carcinomas Table 3 (continued) Cancer type Number of mutations (%) Range (%) References Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (n=10) 0 – [62] Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (n=8) 0 – [58] Epithelioid sarcoma (n=4) 0 – [62] Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma (n=11) 0 – [58, 62] Leiomyosarcoma (n=30) 0 – [58, 62] Low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (n=18) 0 – [58, 62] Mesothelioma (n=4) 0 – [58] Myxofibrosarcoma (n=27) 0 – [62] Osteosarcoma (n=23) 1 (4.3) – [58] Pleomorphic liposarcoma (n=15) 0 – [62] Synovial sarcoma (n=41) 1(2.4) (0–4.0) [58, 62] Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (n=50) 0 – [58, 62] Well-differentiated liposarcoma (n=10) 0 – [58] Virchows Arch (2014) 465:119–133 125 (FCDTC), TERT promoter mutations were found in 7.5 % of PTC, 17.1 % of FTC, 29.0 % of poorly differentiated thyroid carcinomas (PDTC) and 33.0 % of anaplastic thyroid carcinomas (ATC) [80]. This stepwise increase in the frequency of TERT promoter mutations from well to poorly differentiated and undifferentiated carcinomas was also reported in other studies [66, 74] (Table 2). TERT promoter mutations were not detected in normal thyroid tissue, benign lesions or medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). Moreover, very few tumours with oncocytic features harbouring TERT promoter mutations have been reported, and no mutations were detected in a small series of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma nor in tumours from individuals exposed to the Chernobyl accident [58, 77, 121]. The majority (about 80 %) of mutated cases presented the −124G>A mutation. In PTC, TERT promoter mutations were significantly more frequent in BRAF-mutated tumours than in BRAF wild-type tumours [74, 75, 80, 121]. The TERT promoter mutations were associated with increased mRNA expression, and this increase was particularly pronounced in tumours harbouring both BRAF and TERT promoter mutations [121]. Two studies analysed the relationship between TERT promoter mutations, clinico-pathological features and outcome. TERT promoter mutations were significantly associated with older age at diagnosis [74, 80], larger tumour size and higher stage [80]. TERT promoter mutations were also found to be an independent predictor of distant metastases and disease persistence at the end of follow-up in differentiated thyroid carcinomas (DTC) [80]. Patients with TERT promoter-mutated tumours were submitted to more radioiodine treatments with higher doses as well as to other treatment modalities including surgery, external beam irradiation and/or treatment with tyrosine-kinase inhibitors [80]. TERT promoter mutations were significantly associated with disease-specific mortality in the whole FCDTC group; this association held true if the subgroups of patients with DTC, PTC or FTC were independently considered [80]. In DTC, the prognostic value of TERT promoter mutations for disease-specific mortality was independent of age and gender [80]. Altogether, the aforementioned findings indicate that TERT promoter mutations are a major indicator of poor outcome in DTC. The two studies on record onMTC [59, 123] did not reveal TERT promoter mutations in this subtype of thyroid carcinoma. Telomerase promoter mutations in bladder carcinomas The putative role of telomerase in bladder carcinoma (BC) has been a matter of interest in the last two decades. Using TRAP assay, telomerase activity has been evaluated in BC; telomerase activity was detected in the majority of the studied tumours in contrast to the absence of activity in the respective normal counterpart samples [70, 90]. In some series, telomerase activity was associated with lower grade and lower stage BC [84, 90]. Other studies pointed out that both telomerase activity [70] and telomerase expression [126] are associated with higher stage and higher grade [70, 90]. Preliminary evidence obtained in cell lines suggest that BC might have TERT promoter mutations [53]. These early results motivated us and others to search for similar events in bladder tumour samples. Similar to cell lines, the same TERT promoter mutations were detected frequently in BC, with a prevalence ranging from 47 to 85 % (Table 2) [1, 54, 61, 77, 99, 121, 125]. These results rank TERT promoter mutations as one of the most frequent genomic events, possibly the most frequent, in BC [1, 54, 61, 77, 99, 121, 125]. TERT mutations were significantly more frequent among FGFR3 mutant tumours [1]. Wu and colleagues reported a significant co-occurrence of TERT promoter mutations and TP53/RB1 inactivating somatic mutations [125] indicating that both mutations may cooperatively contribute to the progression of BC [125]. Conflicting results have been reported on the association between TERT promoter mutations and clinical stage and/or grade of bladder tumours. Wu and colleagues found that TERT promoter mutations are more prevalent in muscle invasive (MI) than in non-muscle invasive (NMI) tumours and also more prevalent in BC patients with advanced tumour stages (T2–4) than in those with low stage tumours (Ta or T1) [125]. At variance with this, another report found no association between mutation status and stage or grade of BC [54]. Similar results were reported by Allory and colleagues who did not find any differences betweenNMI and MI BC in two independent sets of tumours [1]. Similarly to stage and grade, diverging results were obtained on the association between TERT promoter mutation and prognosis. One group reported that the survival rate of patients with TERT mutations was significantly lower than that of patients without mutations [125], whereas another group found no association between clinical outcome and mutation status [1]. An interesting observation was reported by Rachakonda and colleagues who proposed that a common polymorphism, rs2853669 within a pre-existing Ets2 binding site in the TERT promoter, acts as a modifier of the effect of the mutations on survival and tumour recurrence [99]. The patients with the mutation presented poorer survival in the absence than in the presence of the polymorphism. The mutation in the absence of the variant allele was highly associated with disease recurrence in patients with Tis, Ta and T1 tumours [99]. These results may help to explain some of the divergence reported in studies relating TERT promoter mutations and prognosis of patients with BC. As it was previously noticed, several observations support a model in which TERT somatic mutations are an early event in urothelial carcinogenesis, including their occurrence in a small fraction of subjects with precursor lesions, their presence in tumours of both papillary and invasive features and 126 Virchows Arch (2014) 465:119–133 their low level of intraindividual heterogeneity when analysing multiple tumour regions [1, 58]. TERT promoter mutations may potentially be used as urinary biomarker; several studies have already performed preliminary evaluations of the feasibility, sensibility and specificity of such procedure [1, 54]. Prospective studies based upon series are necessary to further assess the clinical utility of the detection of TERT promoter mutations in urine. Telomerase promoter mutations in central nervous system tumours Central nervous system (CNS) often have TERT promoter mutations competing favourably in this aspect with most other types of human cancer [58, 121]. Among CNS tumours, gliomas are those displaying by far the highest frequency of TERT mutations which can also be detected at lower frequencies in medulloblastoma and meningioma [63]. Within gliomas, the percentage of cases with TERT promoter mutations differs according to the histopathological type of tumour. TERT promoter mutations are detected in the majority of cases of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) [World Health Organization (WHO) Grade IV] which is the most frequent and aggressive form of glioma and in oligodendrogliomas (WHO Grade II and III), in contrast to astrocytoma (WHO Grades I, II and III) and ependymoma (WHO Grades I, II and III), in which only a small percentage of the tumours harbour such mutations (Table 3) [63, 121]. Furthermore, the percentage of TERT promoter mutations in oligoastrocytomas, gliomas with a mixed origin, is intermediate between that of oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas [58]. These findings fit with the reported data on telomerase activity in gliomas which is considerably higher in GBM(50– 89 %) and oligodendrogliomas (75–100 %), than in astrocytomas (0–45 %) [49, 67, 106]. The low frequency of TERT promoter mutations and telomerase activity in grades II and III astrocytomas can be explained by the high prevalence of ATRX mutations, one of the most frequent mutations in this type of glioma [56]. It is known that ATRX mutations trigger ALT in astrocytoma cells and it has been shown that this alternative mechanism is frequently activated in astrocytomas, allowing telomere maintenance without the need for telomerase reactivation [48]. In line with this, the frequency of TERT promoter mutations in secondary GBMs (that arise from the progression of lower grade astrocytomas) is considerably lower than in primary GBMs (that appear de novo) [89]. TERT promoter mutations are rare in paediatric tumours of the CNS [63]. In medulloblastomas that typically develop in children, TERT promoter mutations are mainly detected in tumours of the group of older patients and are associated with sonic hedgehog and WNT mutations [102]. Upregulation of TERT expression in paediatric brain tumours was associated with hypermethylation of the TERT promoter, rather than with TERT promoter mutations [19]. These findings are consistent with the fact that the cells, from which paediatric CNS tumours are thought to originate, still have activated telomerase which obviates the need for activation of TERT through promoter mutation. Although ATRX and TERT promoter mutations provide an explanation for themaintenance of telomere length in most gliomas, TERT upregulation was also reported to occur in a subset of gliomas without TERT promoter mutations or ATRX mutations through an as yet unidentified mechanism [58]. Finally, it is worth noting that, previous to the discovery of TERT promoter mutations in gliomas, some studies had reported an association between SNPs in the TERT gene and an increased risk of glioma development [112, 127]. Telomerase promoter mutations in other tumour types In Tables 2 and 3, we have summarized the data on record on the frequency of TERT promoter mutations in tumours from almost every site. For the sake of simplicity, we divided the tumours into those with a high frequency of mutations (>5 %, Table 2) and tumours with no mutations or with a very low frequency of TERT promoter mutations (<5 %, Table 3). Besides the tumour histotypes with high frequency of TERT promoter mutations described in the previous sections, there are others in which such mutations appear to be particularly prevalent: hepatocellular carcinoma (56 %), several soft tissue tumours histotypes (e.g. 93 % in atypical fibroxanthoma, 79 % in myxoid liposarcoma and 76 % in pleomorphic dermal sarcoma) and carcinoma of the renal pelvis (64 %) (Table 2). Tumour histotypes with intermediate frequencies of TERT promoter mutations include laryngeal carcinoma (27 %) and clear cell carcinoma of the ovary (16 %) (Table 2). The latter value contrasts with the absence or very low frequency of mutations in other ovarian carcinomas (absent in endometrioid carcinoma and in high-grade serous carcinoma) (Table 3) [124]. In clear cell carcinoma of the ovary, TERT promoter mutations tend to be mutually exclusive with the loss of protein expression of ARID1A, a tumour suppressor, and with PI3KCA mutation [124]. Since the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway is involved in the activation of telomerase through phosphorylation, Wu and colleagues advanced that PI3KCA-activating mutations confer a growth advantage on cancer cells by overcoming replicative senescence [124]. At variance with other tumour models (gliomas, melanomas, follicular cell derived carcinoma and others), no associations with disease specific survival were observed for ovarian clear cell carcinoma [124]. There are also differences regarding the putative (early or late) timing of the occurrence of TERT promoter mutations in the oncogenic processes of the various tumour models. TERT promoter mutations seem to be present in two settings. As Virchows Arch (2014) 465:119–133 127 described by Killela and colleagues, TERT promoter mutations can be relevant in tissues with relatively low rates of selfrenewal [58], an association that fits with the findings in follicular cell-derived thyroid cancer and gliomas. In these two settings (thyroid cancer and gliomas), TERT promoter mutations are associated with a guarded prognosis of the patients harbouring the tumours and probably represent late events of the oncogenic process. On the other hand, TERT promoter mutations can also result from environmental factors such as ultraviolet radiation and chemical carcinogens as suggested by their high frequency in melanoma, basal cell carcinoma and bladder and tongue carcinomas. In this second setting, TERT promoter mutations appear to be an early tumorigenic event and do not carry major prognostic value, with the exception of melanoma. Why clear cut differences exist in the frequency of TERT promoter mutations in tumours of the same system (e.g. hepatocellular carcinoma versus pancreatic carcinoma) remains to be clarified, although there is enough evidence to claim that the high or low prevalence of the mutations appears to be histotype- rather than site-associated. For instance, the high frequency in transitional carcinoma of the bladder and renal pelvis is in contrast to low frequency/absence in kidney carcinoma and the extremely low frequency/absence in adenocarcinomas of every organ of the gastrointestinal tract (Tables 2 and 3). Telomerase as a therapeutic target Several therapy strategies have been suggested to control TERT expression in tumours, mainly using small molecule inhibitors, gene therapy approaches and immunotherapy (reviewed in [82]). Inhibition of enzymatic activity with small synthetic molecules allows the disruption of the replicative capacity of cancer cells; in this way, it is though that normal somatic cells will not be affected due to the absence of TERT activity. In vitro studies showed that BIBR1532, a noncompetitive inhibitor of both TERT and TERC [92], leads to cellular senescence reducing proliferation and telomere length [24] and is cytotoxic in high doses [28]. Additionally, a marked reduction of the tumorigenic potential of tumour cells treated with BIBR1532 was observed in a mouse xenograft model [24], with no adverse side effects and uncomplicated oral administration of the drug. BIBR1532 is one of the most promising TERT specific-inhibitors to date. Other small synthetic molecules—G-quadruplex ligands, such as BRACO19, RHSP4 and telomestatin—are promising drugs that can be used for TERT targeting therapies [103]. However, clinical testing of some of these molecules has been hampered due to the toxic characteristics of the compounds [82]. Cancer cells with TERT activity can be directly targeted by introducing suicide genes or oncolytic viruses driven by the TERT or TERC promoters, or the inhibition of TERT or TERC activity targeting their RNAs. In the latter strategy, antisense oligonucleotides, small interfering RNAs and ribozymes can be applied for inhibition of TERT activity. GRN163L (also known as imetelstat) is the most studied antisense oligonucleotide that causes TERT inhibition and telomere shortening in cancer cell lines derived from different organs [13]. This compound leads to apoptosis of cells and to inhibition of tumour growth, and it is being used in clinical trials of several cancer types [13]. DNA vaccines (immunotherapy) have been used to generate protective immunity against tumours in several models [96]. The presence of TERT activity in many human cancers turns TERT a tumour-associated antigen suitable for cancer immunotherapy. Contrary to other target antigens, as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and melanoma-associated antigen, TERT-based immunotherapy may be applied to a wide range of malignancies due to the highly frequent TERT-altered expression [122]. In vitro and in vivo studies showed tumour regression using TERT-based vaccination approaches (reviewed in [72]). Different peptides have been used to induce anti-TERT immune response [13] and vaccination using the I540–548 peptide showed anti-tumour responses in cancer [122]. Several preclinical studies using TERT peptides are being conducted (reviewed in [103]). GV-1001, GRNVAC 1 and Vx-001 are the most promising vaccines available to date. Future perspectives The implication of telomerase in human diseases has been studied for a long time and firmly established in a few models of degenerative diseases. In cancer, telomerase dysfunction has been perceived as a potential mechanism for carcinogenesis although the underlying mechanisms remained elusive. The recent identification of telomerase promoter mutations in several types of neoplasia fostered the respective research, and in less than a year, numerous studies have been published reporting similar alterations in many cancer models (Tables 2 and 3). In several relevant cancer types, telomerase promoter mutations seem to constitute a new biomarker for prognosis with potential applications in pre-surgical diagnosis and in the follow-up of the patients. Low-grade bladder cancers represent a good example on how such finding can represent an added value from a clinical standpoint. Up to 70 % of lowgrade non-invasive bladder tumours recur, and long-term cystoscopic surveillance is the current standard of care. This procedure is expensive and time consuming and carries significant morbidity. The non-invasive evaluation of telomerase promoter mutations in urine may provide diagnostic 128 Virchows Arch (2014) 465:119–133 information, independent of routine cytology, and most importantly, may identify low-grade tumours, which are difficult to identify by cytological examination alone. Whenever dealing with a recurrence, a non-invasive diagnostic test that also serves as a surveillance method will probably represent an attractive alternative for patients, taking into consideration the limitations of the technique. A preliminary evaluation of the diagnostic usefulness of the detection of TERT promoter mutations was already performed in urine samples, and the results indicate that such detection may serve as a biomarker of early disease and recurrence [1, 54]. Moving to a trendier subject, it seems extremely interesting to evaluate whether or not TERT promoter mutations can be detected in tumour-circulating DNA from cell-free fragments in body fluids. In the affirmative case, this process may represent a major advance in the follow-up of cancer patients. Despite the large amount of information collected in these recent years, more questions than answers remain at present with regard to the role of telomerase involvement in carcinogenesis. A novel mechanism for telomerase re-activation and/ or re-expression was discovered; this mechanism, together with ALT, represents the two major pathways for telomere length maintenance. Besides them, other mechanisms may modulate telomerase expression, such as novel forms of transcriptional regulation or epigenetic alterations. We think it is the appropriate time to study large series with robust clinicopathological data and to search for correlations that may establish or rule out the prognostic value of TERT promoter mutations in the various types of human cancer. Last but not least, cell and molecular biology studies are mandatory to understand the role(s) of telomerase in cancer cells that appear to go beyond the increased replicative potential (immortalization) and have impact also in metastatic capacities.  Malignant cells, like all actively growing cells, must maintain their telomeres, but genetic mechanisms responsible for telomere maintenance in tumors have only recently been discovered. In particular, mutations of the telomere binding proteins alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX) or death-domain associated protein (DAXX) have been shown to underlie a telomere maintenance mechanism not involving telomerase (alternative lengthening of telomeres), and point mutations in the promoter of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene increase telomerase expression and have been shown to occur in melanomas and a small number of other tumors. To further define the tumor types in which this latter mechanism plays a role, we surveyed 1,230 tumors of 60 different types. We found that tumors could be divided into types with low (<15%) and high (≥15%) frequencies of TERT promoter mutations. The nine TERT-high tumor types almost always originated in tissues with relatively low rates of self renewal, including melanomas, liposarcomas, hepatocellular carcinomas, urothelial carcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas of the tongue, medulloblastomas, and subtypes of gliomas (including 83% of primary glioblastoma, the most common brain tumor type). TERT and ATRX mutations were mutually exclusive, suggesting that these two genetic mechanisms confer equivalent selective growth advantages. In addition to their implications for understanding the relationship between telomeres and tumorigenesis, TERT mutations provide a biomarker that may be useful for the early detection of urinary tract and liver tumors and aid in the classification and prognostication of brain tumors.  Telomeres are nucleoprotein complexes at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes that are required for chromosomal integrity. Several hundred nucleotides of telomere repeats cap each chromosomal end, and in the absence of telomerase activity, telomeres shorten with each cell division (1). Eventually, uncapped telomeres trigger cell death or senescence. Cancer cells seem to divide ad infinitum and therefore, require some telomere maintenance mechanism to avoid this fate. Because telomerase activity is generally higher in cancer cells than normal cells, it was originally believed that telomerase was somehow activated in cancer cells (2–6). However, it was subsequently realized that telomerase was only inactive in terminally differentiated cells and that normal stem cells in self-renewing tissues retained telomerase activity (1, 7–9). Because normal stem cells must replicate throughout the long lifetimes of mammals (which can be more than a century in humans), it is clear that such cells must also retain telomerase activity. Because normal stem cells are thought to be the progenitors of cancers, there would be no need to specifically activate telomerase in cancer cells; the enzyme was already active in the precursors, just as were the hundreds of other enzymes and proteins normally required for cell proliferation.  This view was challenged by the discovery of another mechanism for maintaining telomere length [i.e., alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT)] (10–12). ALT occurs in the absence of telomerase activity and seems to be dependent on homologous recombination. It occurs in a particularly high fraction of certain tumor types, such as sarcomas, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, and brain tumors, but rarely in most common tumor types, such as those tumor types of the colon, breast, lung, prostate, or pancreas (13). Why would cancer cells need ALT if telomerase activity was already constitutively active in their precursors? This question was highlighted by the discovery that many ALT cancers harbor mutations in alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX) or death-domain associated protein (DAXX), genes encoding proteins that interact with each other at telomeres (10, 11). Presumably, the absence of functional ATRX/DAXX complexes permits the homologous recombination resulting in ALT. At minimum, these data were compatible with the ideas that there could be a selective advantage for genetic alterations that results in telomere maintenance and that telomerase is not indefinitely activated in all normal stem cell precursors of cancers.  Another challenge to the idea that genetic alterations were not required for telomerase activation in cancer was raised by the finding that mutations of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter occurred in ∼70% of melanomas and in a small number of tumor cell lines derived from various tissue types (14, 15). Importantly, only 5 of 110 cell lines derived from lung, stomach, ovary, uterus, or prostate cancers harbored TERT promoter mutations, whereas 19 mutations were found among 37 cell lines derived from various other tumor types. This situation is analogous to the situation for ALT, which is infrequently observed in common epithelial cancers but is observed more regularly in tumors derived from nonepithelial cells, particularly sarcomas and brain tumors (13).  These findings prompted us to formulate a hypothesis about the mechanisms responsible for telomerase activity in cancers. We suggest that there are two ways to maintain telomere lengths as cells divide: (i) through epigenetic regulation of telomerase activity, which occurs in stem cells of tissues that are rapidly renewing, and (ii) through somatic mutations that maintain telomere lengths, such as mutations in the TERT promoter or mutations in DAXX or ATRX. Those cancers that originate in tissues that are constantly self-renewing, such as cancers of the epithelia of the gastrointestinal tract and skin or bone marrow, would be unlikely to harbor telomere-maintaining mutations, because telomerase is already epigenetically activated in their precursor cells. In contrast, tumors arising from cells that are not constantly self-renewing, such as neurons, glial cells, fibroblasts, hepatocytes, islet cells, and pancreatic ductal epithelial cells, might frequently harbor such mutations. A corollary of this hypothesis is that tumor types exhibiting high frequencies of ALT would also exhibit high frequencies of TERT mutations, and these mutations would be distributed in a mutually exclusive fashion. To test these hypotheses as well as answer other questions related to the role of TERT promoter mutations in various cancer types, we determined the prevalence of TERT promoter mutations in a large number of tumors.  Go to: RESULTS We attempted to evaluate at least 20 individual specimens of common tumor types and fewer specimens of rare tumor types, depending on availability of specimens in our laboratories. In those tumor types in which our pilot studies showed a significant number of mutations, additional tumors were evaluated. Melanomas and tumors of the lung, stomach, and esophagus were excluded, because they had already been adequately evaluated in the seminal papers cited (14, 15). When primary tumors rather than cell lines were used, we ensured that the fraction of neoplastic cells was >50% through histopathologic examination of frozen sections of the tissue blocks used for DNA purification. In those cases in which the neoplastic content was <50%, we microdissected the lesions to enrich the neoplastic content to >50%. Primers were designed to amplify the region containing the two TERT mutations that were previously described—C228T and C250T—corresponding to the positions 124 and 146 bp, respectively, upstream of the TERT ATG start site (14, 15). The PCR fragments were then purified and analyzed by conventional Sanger sequencing.  In all, we evaluated TERT promoter mutations in 1,230 tumor specimens and identified 231 mutations (18.8%) (Table 1). C228T and C250T mutations accounted for 77.5% and 20.8% of the alterations, respectively (Dataset S1). Additionally, we detected four mutations that had not been observed previously: three C228A mutations and one C229A mutation (Dataset S1). All four of these mutations as well as a representative subset of the C228T and C250T mutations (n = 59) were somatic, as evidenced by their absence in normal tissues of the patients containing the mutations in their tumors.  Table 1. Table 1. Frequency of TERT promoter mutations The 1,230 tumors represented 60 tumor types. In 26 of these tumor types, at least 15 individual tumors were evaluated (comprising a total of 1,043 individual tumors) (Fig. 1). In the remaining tumor types, only a small number of samples (2–12) was available, in part because these tumor types are generally uncommon in Western populations (Table 1). Among the tumor types in which at least 15 individual tumors were available for study, a clear distinction could be made. Eighteen of these tumor types had only occasional TERT promoter mutations (zero to three mutations, comprising 0–15% of the tumors of each type) (Fig. 1). We classified these tumor types as TERT-low (TERT-L), because they had a low frequency of TERT promoter mutations. Eight other tumor types were classified as TERT-high (TERT-H) because of their relatively high prevalence of TERT promoter mutations (16–83% of the tumors of each type).  Fig. 1. Fig. 1. Frequency of TERT promoter mutations; 15 or more tumors were analyzed in 26 tumor types. Gliomas are divided into primary GBM, astrocytoma (including astrocytoma grades II and III, as well as secondary GBM), and oligodendroglioma. The TERT-L tumor types included some of the most prevalent cancers, including epithelial tumors of the breast, prostate, thyroid, pancreas, gall bladder, uterus, and colon (as well as tumors of the lung, stomach, and esophagus based on prior studies) (14, 15) and leukemias. In fact, no TERT mutations were identified in any specimen of 30 tumor types that we studied, comprising a total of 546 tumors (Table 1). Some nonepithelial cancers, such as synovial sarcomas, chordomas, neuroblastomas, osteosarcomas, and ependymomas, were also TERT-L.  Eight TERT-H tumor types were identified (in addition to the previously described melanomas) (14, 15). These tumors included tumors of the CNS, transitional cell carcinomas of the urinary tract, hepatocellular carcinomas, myxoid liposarcomas, and oral cavity carcinomas. Although only a small number of TERT-H tumors (other than melanomas) were examined in previous studies (15), mutations in gliomas, hepatocellular, and oral cavity carcinomas were detected, which would be expected on the basis of the high frequency of mutation in these tumors types (Table 1).  Clinical and Molecular Correlations in TERT-H Tumors. Sarcomas. One of the highest frequencies of TERT promoter mutation was found in myxoid liposarcoma (19 of 24 tumors, 79% with mutation). Myxoid liposarcomas account for more than one-third of all liposarcomas and ∼10% of all adult soft tissue sarcomas (16). Patients are relatively young, with a peak age range between 30 and 50 y. At the genetic level, the most characteristic change is a t(12;16) (q13;p11) chromosomal translocation that results in the fusion of the FUS and DDIT3 genes (16, 17). The cellular origin of these tumors is unknown, but preadipocytic progenitor cells and mesenchymal stem cells have been implicated (18); after embryogenesis, the mitotic activity of these cells is thought to be low. Other sarcomas, also thought to originate from mesenchymal cells that do not self-renew in the absence of damage, were not TERT-H (Table 1). These sarcomas included synovial sarcomas (0% of 16 tumors) and osteosarcomas (4.3% of 23 tumors). Of note, myxoid liposarcomas have been previously shown to have a relatively high prevalence of ALT (24% of 38 tumors) (13, 19). The data, in aggregate, are compatible with the idea that myxoid liposarcomas almost always genetically activate telomere maintenance genes through either TERT promoter mutations or ALT.  Hepatocellular carcinomas. Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) are the third leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide, and their incidence is increasing in the United States (20). Most HCCs in the United States are associated with Hepatitis B or C Virus infection, whereas others are associated with alcoholic cirrhosis; 44% of HCC samples that we evaluated harbored TERT promoter mutations (27/61). This finding makes TERT the most commonly mutated gene yet observed in this tumor type (21, 22). The mutations seemed to occur relatively early in tumorigenesis, because they were observed in 39% of stage I well-differentiated HCCs (Table S1). TERT mutations were observed in virally associated tumors as well as cases without any underlying liver disease at similar frequencies (Table S1). There was also no difference in the prevalence of TERT promoter mutations with respect to sex, age, or ethnicity (Table S1). ALT has been observed in 7% of 121 HCCs studied previously (13).  Urinary tract cancers. Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder is the fourth most common type of cancer in American males. In 2013, over 73,000 patients will be diagnosed with bladder cancer leading to approximately 15,000 deaths in the US alone (23). Two-thirds of the 21 urothelial carcinomas of the bladder that we studied harbored TERT promoter mutations. We were also able to evaluate 19 urothelial carcinomas of the upper urinary tract, a much less common anatomic site for this histopathologic subtype of tumor. Nine of nineteen upper urinary tract urothelial carcinomas harbored TERT mutations. TERT mutations are, therefore, the most frequently mutated genes yet identified in urothelial carcinoma of either the bladder or upper urinary tract (24). The prevalence of ALT in bladder cancers is very low (1% of 188 cancers) (13).  Head and neck cancers. Head and neck cancers are almost always squamous cell carcinomas and can occur throughout the oral cavity lining (mucous membranes of the cheek, hard and soft palate, tongue, supraglottis, etc.). It is the sixth most common cancer in the world, and 50,000 cases occurred in the United States in 2012. We identified TERT promoter mutations in 17% of 70 oral cavity cancers that we evaluated. However, the anatomic distribution of the cases with TERT promoter mutations was striking: 11 of 12 cancers with TERT promoter mutations were in the oral tongue, although only 23 of 70 total cases originated in the oral tongue (P < 0.0001, Fisher exact probability test, two-tailed) (Table S2). The basis for this extraordinary selectivity is curious given the shared characteristics of the squamous epithelium lining the tongue and other parts of the head and neck, including the oral cavity. Moreover, we evaluated 22 squamous cell carcinomas of another site (the cervix) and found only one TERT mutation (4.5%) (Table 1). Most cervical squamous cell carcinomas and a subset of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas are caused by human papillomavirus, which can activate telomerase by expressing E6 and E7 viral oncogenes (25). These findings raise the possibility that human papillomavirus infection and TERT mutation may be alternative mechanisms to activate telomerase among squamous cell carcinomas. We were unable to test correlations between TERT promoter mutations and HPV status or other clinical parameters because of the small number of patients with available data (Table S2). There have been no ALT cases identified among 70 head and neck cancers, including 41 oral cavity cancers (13).  Medulloblastomas. Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor of childhood (26). TERT mutations occurred in 21% of 91 medulloblastomas that we evaluated. As with the oral cavity cancers, TERT mutations were not distributed randomly among the medulloblastoma patients. Although medulloblastomas are usually diagnosed at a young age, those medulloblastomas with TERT mutations were diagnosed at a considerably older age (median = 6 vs. 16 y, P = 0.0012, t test assuming unequal variances, two-tailed) (Fig. S1A). This observation has important implications for understanding the basis for the selectivity of the tumor types harboring TERT promoter mutations (Discussion); 45 of 90 patients had been assessed previously for orthodenticle homeobox 2 (OTX2) gene amplification and expression, and alterations in this transcription factor are known to correlate with clinically distinct molecular subtypes of medulloblastoma (27). OTX2 expression was >100-fold higher in medulloblastoma patients without TERT promoter mutations than in those patients with TERT promoter mutations (note the log scale in Fig. S1B). The high levels of OTX2 expression were usually the result of OTX2 gene amplification (Fig. S1C). The association of TERT promoter mutations with an older age at diagnosis and a lack of OTX2 overexpression raises the possibility that TERT mutations occur in a specific clinical and molecular subtype of medulloblastoma. The most likely molecular subtype of medulloblastoma that may be enriched for TERT mutations is the noninfant sonic hedgehog subtype, which is characterized by an older age at diagnosis and lower expression of OTX2 (28, 29). Larger studies will be needed to make this association more definitive. ALT has been observed in 7% of 55 medulloblastomas studied previously (13).  Gliomas. Gliomas are the most common CNS tumor type and accounted for >14,000 deaths in the United States last year (30). Histopathological and clinical criteria established by the World Health Organization are used to characterize these tumors into several subtypes (30). We considered the four main subtypes individually (Table S3).  Primary glioblastoma. These primary glioblastomas (GBMs) are the most common malignant brain tumors in adults, accounting for ∼17% of all intracranial tumors, and they confer the worst survival (median of ∼15 mo) (31). These high-grade (grade IV) tumors have no detectable precursor lesions and have been referred to as de novo tumors. The prevalence of TERT promoter mutations was remarkably high in GBMs of adults (83% of 78 tumors) (Table S3). This prevalence is higher than the prevalence of any other genetic mutation in this tumor type (32). These findings provide a molecular mechanism responsible for the high levels of TERT mRNA and telomerase activity observed in GBMs (33).  For 51 of 78 primary GBM tumors, data on other common genetic alterations as well as clinical data were available (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, EGFR amplification, a classic molecular feature of primary GBM, exclusively occurred in tumors with TERT mutations (P = 0.0006, Fisher exact probability test, two-tailed). Conversely, no association was identified between TERT mutation and either TP53 mutation or CDKN2A deletion. Importantly, the frequency of TERT promoter mutations was considerably less in primary GBMs of pediatric patients (11% of 19 tumors) than adult patients (Discussion) (Table S3). ALT was observed in 11% of 105 adult GBM and 44% of pediatric GBM (i.e., the reverse of the pattern observed for TERT promoter mutations) (13). Primary GBM patients without TERT mutations survived considerably longer, on average, than patients with such mutations (median = 27 vs. 14 mo, P = 0.01 by the log rank test) (Fig. S3).  Fig. 2. Fig. 2. Mutations of selected genes in glioma subtypes. (A) Distribution of TERT mutations and other genetic events in 51 primary GBMs. (B) Distribution of TERT mutations and other genetic events among 40 astrocytomas, including grades II–III astrocytomas ... Astrocytomas. Infiltrative astrocytic tumors frequently progress, with recurrent lesions often of higher grade than the original lesions excised at surgery. They are most often grade II or III but can progress to grade IV (at which point they are often termed secondary GBMs). Astrocytomas of any stage rarely contained TERT promoter mutations (10% of 40 total samples) (Table S3). Instead, they more frequently contained isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) or isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) mutations (75% of 40 tumors), ATRX mutations (70% of 40 tumors), and TP53 mutations (73% of 40 tumors) (Fig. 2B). ALT has been observed in 63% of 57 astrocytomas, consistent with the high prevalence of ATRX mutations (13). The lack of activating TERT mutations in IDH1 mutant tumors is also corroborated by the lack of TERT mRNA and telomerase activity observed in these lesions (33).  Oligodendrogliomas. Like astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas often progress, and they frequently contain TERT promoter mutations (78% of 45 tumor samples) (Table S3). Oligodendroglioma was the only tumor type studied (of all types, including non-CNS tumors) (Dataset S1) in which C250T mutations were nearly as frequent as C228T mutations. In oligodendrogliomas, 43% of tumors with TERT mutations contained C250T substitutions, whereas in other gliomas, only 10% did (P < 0.001, Fisher exact probability test, two-tailed). Interestingly, 91% of 45 oligodendrogliomas that were evaluated for ATRX and TERT sequence alterations contained either an ATRX coding or a TERT promoter mutation, suggesting that genetic alterations resulting in telomere maintenance are required for tumorigenesis of this subtype.  Oligodendrogliomas have long been known to contain characteristic losses of chromosome arms 1p and 19q, and these losses reflect inactivation of the CIC gene on chromosome 19q and in some cases, inactivation of the FUBP1 gene on chromosome 1p (34–36). Accordingly, 78% of 45 oligodendrogliomas contained chromosome arm 1p or 19q losses of heterozygosity (Fig. 2C) (34–36). Moreover, nearly all of them contained IDH1 or IDH2 mutations (93%).  Oligoastrocytomas. As their name implies, these tumors are mixed, with histologic features of both oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas. This mixture, in part, reflects the difficulties in distinguishing the various glioma subtypes from one another on the basis of histopathologic or clinical criteria (37). The genetic features of this tumor subtype reflect this mixture: the prevalence of TERT promoter mutations (25% of 24 tumors) was intermediate between oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas, as were the frequencies of chromosome (Chr) 1p/19q losses and IDH1/2, TP53, and ATRX mutations (Fig. 2D).  ALT Vs. TERT. ALT has been observed in tumors of the CNS (particularly gliomas) more frequently than tumors of any other tissue type. Given that TERT promoter mutations are also common in gliomas, the relationship between these two features could be determined with high confidence. The tumors depicted in Fig. 2 had previously been evaluated for alterations in ATRX, which is a nearly perfect surrogate for the ALT phenotype (11, 37). Our data show that there were 50 gliomas with ATRX mutations and 83 gliomas with TERT mutations; 0 of 83 tumors with TERT mutations contained ATRX mutations (P < 0.0001, Fisher exact probability test, two-tailed).  Go to: DISCUSSION The results described above, as well as the results published in refs. 14 and 15, provide evidence that supports one of the hypotheses raised in the Introduction and refutes others. The first of these hypotheses was that TERT mutations would only be observed in tumors derived from tissues that are not constantly self-renewing under normal circumstances. This hypothesis was supported in part: the vast majority of TERT promoter mutations occurred in tumors derived from tissues that do not continually self-renew. The TERT-H tumor types include only melanomas, certain subtypes of glioma, medulloblastomas, squamous cell cancers of the tongue, liposarcomas, HCCs, and urinary tract cancers. The normal transitional cells of the urinary tract have very low proliferative indices (0.64% ± 0.52%), much lower than indices of gastrointestinal tract, bone marrow, or skin (38). Normal hepatocytes also do not turnover often (39), and glial cells are thought to have limited capacity for self-renewal (40).  Two other observations also support the hypothesis. Pediatric primary GBMs rarely contained TERT mutations (11%), whereas adult primary GBMs frequently did (83%). Pediatric GBMs are presumably derived from cells that are still dividing at the time of tumor initiation, and therefore, there is no selective advantage conferred by activating telomerase through a genetic mutation. Adult GBMs, in contrast, are presumably derived from postmitotic cells, and they should require telomerase activation. Similarly, medulloblastomas are embryonal tumors that typically arise from precursor cells with high self-renewal rates that do not usually persist in adults. This finding is consistent with our observation that the mean age of medulloblastoma patients with TERT mutations was considerably older than the mean age of medulloblastoma patients without TERT mutations (Fig. S1A).  There are, however, exceptions that belie the hypothesis that TERT mutations occur only in non–self-renewing tissues. The epithelium that lines the tongue constantly self-renews, but many squamous carcinomas of the tongue harbored TERT mutations (Table S2). Additionally, the squamous epithelia of the tongue certainly would not be expected to self-renew less than other squamous epithelia of the oral cavity, but the latter rarely harbored TERT mutations (Table S2). This finding may suggest that squamous carcinomas of the tongue originate from a different cell of origin than other oral cavity squamous carcinomas. Conversely, only a subset of the tumor types derived from non–self-renewing tissues was TERT-H. For example, the TERT-H tumors included myxoid liposarcomas but not synovial sarcomas. Moreover, cells of the pancreas (the islets of Langerhans and the ductal epithelial cells) rarely renew, but pancreatic tumors of all types (pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, acinar carcinomas, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas) were all TERT-L. The most that we can conclude at present is that non–self-renewing cell types are the major sources of TERT-H tumors but that non–self-renewal is only one of the factors that determines whether tumor cells with TERT promoter mutations will have a selective growth advantage over adjoining cells.  The first corollary to the hypothesis raised in the Introduction was that tumor types that displayed ALT would be those types that harbored TERT promoter mutations. This corollary is soundly refuted by these data, at least in general terms. Although tumor types of the CNS and liposarcomas had high frequencies of ALT as well as high frequencies of TERT promoter mutations, these tumor types were the exceptions rather than the rule. For example, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors have very high frequencies of ALT but no evidence of TERT mutations. Conversely, bladder cancers frequently have TERT mutations but never have ALT (13). Additionally, even among gliomas, pediatric GBMs have high frequencies of ALT and low frequencies of TERT mutations, whereas adult GBMs have the reverse pattern.  The second corollary was that the selective advantage afforded by TERT mutation would be equivalent to the advantage afforded by ATRX mutation (conferring ALT). This hypothesis was most effectively tested in gliomas, in which both ATRX coding and TERT promoter mutations were common. There was a striking mutual exclusivity with respect to ATRX and TERT mutations (P < 0.0001), lending strong support to this idea.  These results also raise many unanswered questions. In some tumor types, such as gliomas, we can imagine that all tumors have genetically activated telomere maintenance programs through mutations in either TERT or ATRX. However, in other tumor types with frequent ATRX mutations, such as pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, what is responsible for activating telomerase in the fraction of cases not exhibiting ALT if it is not a mutation in the TERT promoter? Similarly, what is responsible for activating telomerase in those tumors derived from non–self-renewing cell types in which neither ALT nor TERT mutations is frequently observed, such as synovial sarcomas or osteosarcomas? Also, there are occasional individual tumors among the TERT-L types that have TERT promoter mutations (e.g., cervical cancers, ovarian cancers, and in ref. 15, lung cancers). What distinguishes these occasional cancers from others of the same histopathologic subtype? Whole-genome sequencing studies, rather than those studies limited to the exome, might provide answers to these questions.  The results recorded here have practical as well as basic scientific implications. Two-thirds of bladder cancers had TERT promoter mutations, making it the most commonly mutated gene yet identified in invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. Given the persistently high mortality rate despite multimodality treatment in this group of patients, these mutations represent ideal urinary biomarkers to detect bladder cancers at an early stage and to follow patients for evidence of progression or recurrence once they have been diagnosed (41). Similarly, the high prevalence of TERT promoter mutations in HCCs and glioma subtypes provides excellent candidate biomarkers for early detection (HCC) or monitoring (HCC in the plasma and gliomas in the cerebrospinal fluid) (42, 43).  Another practical implication involves diagnostics. We conjecture that tumors with TERT promoter or ATRX mutations are derived from different precursor cells and that either type of precursor cell is different from those types that are the precursors of tumors without such mutations. This distinction could aid classification of the tumors in clinically meaningful ways. For example, Fig. 2 and Fig. S2 outline the major genetic alterations occurring in the three most common types of gliomas. On the basis of the data in Fig. 2 A–C, we speculate that oligodendrogliomas that lack TERT mutations but contain ATRX mutations may behave more like astrocytomas than oligodendrogliomas and vice versa. Similarly, the primary GBMs without TERT mutations (15% of the total) may behave more like advanced progressive astrocytomas, which generally lack TERT mutations. This possibility is supported by the observation that those primary GBM patients without TERT mutations had a longer survival, on average, than other primary GBM patients (Fig. S3).  Go to: METHODS All clinical information and tissue were obtained with consent and Institutional Review Board approval from the various institutions donating material to this study, and they were obtained in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Tissue sections were reviewed by board-certified pathologists to ensure that ≥50% of the cells used for DNA purification were neoplastic and confirm histopathological diagnosis. Oligonucleotides with the sequences 5′-M13-GGCCGATTCGACCTCTCT-3′ and 5′-AGCACCTCGCGGTAGTGG-3′, where M13 is a universal sequencing priming site with sequence 5′-tgtaaaacgacggccagt-3′, were used to PCR-amplify the proximal TERT promoter containing C228 and C250 (chr5: 1,295,228; chr5: 1,295,250, respectively; hg19) for Sanger sequencing using standard methods (44). Primary GBM copy number data as well as ALT status were derived from the data published in refs. 37, 45, and 46, and OTX2 copy number expression was derived from the data published in ref. 27. Brain tumor patients were treated at the Tisch Brain Tumor Center at Duke. For the purposes of this study, secondary GBM designates a GBM that was resected >1 y after a prior diagnosis of a lower-grade glioma (grades I–III), and all other GBMs were considered to be primary GBMs. Pediatric GBM samples were defined as those samples occurring before 21 y of age.
32||Heterozygous mutations in the telomerase components TERT, the reverse transcriptase, and TERC, the RNA template, cause autosomal dominant dyskeratosis congenita due to telomere shortening. Anticipation, whereby the disease severity increases in succeeding generations due to inheritance of shorter telomeres, is a feature of this condition. Here we describe 2 families in which 2 TERT mutations are segregating. Both families contain compound heterozygotes. In one case the proband is homozygous for a novel mutation causing a P704S substitution, while his father's second allele encodes an H412Y mutation. The proband in the second family has mutant alleles Y846C and H876Q. Transfection studies show codominant expression of the mutated alleles with no evidence of a dominant negative effect or of intragenic complementation. Thus in these families the expression of both TERT alleles and the inherited telomere length contribute to the clinical phenotype.  Go to: Introduction Mutations in genes encoding components of the telomerase ribonucleoprotein complex resulting in very short telomeres have been identified in patients with dyskeratosis congenita (DC), a rare inherited bone marrow failure syndrome.1–6 X-linked DC is caused by mutations in the DKC1 gene, encoding a protein necessary for the stabilization of the TERC RNA. Individuals with autosomal dominant DC (AD DC) are heterozygous for mutations in the telomerase RNA TERC or the gene encoding the catalytic subunit TERT.2–5 In contrast to patients with X-linked DC, who usually develop severe disease with a high penetrance, disease penetrance and expressivity in AD DC are highly variable and, in addition to the gene mutation, the inheritance of short telomeres is required for the manifestation of the disease.7,8 Here we demonstrate that the inheritance of AD DC may be complex. We report a DC patient homozygous for a TERT mutation and compound heterozygotes in 2 separate families with apparent codominance of the 2 mutations  Go to: Methods Clinical and genetic information was obtained through our ongoing study on the molecular mechanisms of bone marrow failure (http://bmf.im.wustl.edu). The study is approved by the Washington University School of Medicine Institutional Review Board. Informed consent was obtained in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. DNA for mutation analysis was extracted from peripheral blood cells (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Telomere length measurements in peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMC) by flow-FISH and direct DNA sequencing were previously described.8 Primers used are shown in Table S1 (available on the Blood website; see the Supplemental Materials link at the top of the online article).  The mutations identified were introduced in the p3.1+ TERT plasmid9 using the QuickChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Wild-type (WT) or mutant TERT plasmid (4 μg) were transfected into WI-38 VA-13 cells at 80% confluence in the presence of an equal amount of pUC TERC using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).10 In cotransfection experiments, 2 μg of each mutant TERT plasmid were used. Thirty-six hours after transfection, telomerase activities were determined in cell lysates at protein concentrations of 40, 10, 2.5, and 0.625 ng using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR)–based TRAP assay as previously described.11  Go to: Results and discussion Figure 1A shows the pedigrees of families 199 and 284. Patient 199.1 is a 31-year-old man of Scottish descent. His clinical manifestations include short stature; elfin appearance; esophageal stricture; leukoplakia of the buccal mucosa, anus, and penis; abnormal pigmentation of his neck, trunk, and back; hyperkeratosis of his palms; ridged fingernails; avascular necrosis of both hips; tooth loss; chronic diarrhea; learning difficulties; pulmonary infiltrates; and progressive bone marrow failure (Figure 1B). His 61-year-old father was diagnosed with osteoporosis at the age of 60. His 60-year-old mother is healthy. Both parents have normal peripheral blood cell counts. The paternal grandmother (age, 84 years) has a history of anemia, osteoporosis, and pulmonary fibrosis. The maternal grandmother was reported to have died at the age of 60 years because of pulmonary fibrosis.  Figure 1 Figure 1 Pedigrees and clinical manifestations in TERT mutations (A) Pedigrees and identified TERT gene mutations in families 199 and 284. Circles, females; squares, males; white, wild type; color, mutant as indicated in the chart. Half-filled symbols indicate ... Mutation analysis revealed that patient 199.1 is homozygous for a C to T transition in exon 5 of the TERT gene (cDNA nt C2110T) causing a proline to serine substitution at amino acid 704 (P704S). Functional analysis in WI-38 VA-13 cells demonstrated that the TERT P704S mutation severely reduces telomerase activity to 13% of normal (P < .001; Figure 2A). Both parents are heterozygous for the TERT P704S mutation (Figure 1A). Interestingly, however, the father carries a second TERT mutation in exon 2. This C1234T mutation (H412Y), has been previously described in an unrelated family.3 This mutation reduced telomerase activity to 36% of normal in our transfection experiments (P < .001; Figure 2A). Coexpression of WT TERT with either the P704S or H412Y variants did not show evidence of a dominant negative effect. The coexpression of the 2 TERT mutations resulted in an intermediate telomerase activity of 22% (P < .001; Figure 2B), suggesting a synergic effect on telomerase activity and no intragenic complementation. Careful analysis of the family tree revealed that the parents are fourth cousins, explaining the presence of the TERT P704S mutation in both parents.  Figure 2 Figure 2 Telomerase activity and telomere lengths of wild-type and mutant individuals. (A) In vitro telomerase activity of the mutant TERT proteins in WI-38 VA-13 cells. WI-38 VA-13 cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing the mutant TERT cDNA sequences ... Telomere length measurement in family 199 revealed that patient 199.1 has very short telomeres (below the 1st percentile of the normal telomere length distribution; Figure 2C). Interestingly, the father (199.2), who is compound heterozygous for the TERT P704S and H412Y mutations, has also very short telomeres, whereas the mother (199.3), who is heterozygous for TERT P704S mutation, has a normal telomere length.  Patient 284.1 is an 8-year-old girl of European descent, originally diagnosed with moderate but progressive aplastic anemia. Both of her parents are healthy with no abnormalities in the peripheral blood. Family history was negative for blood diseases, pulmonary fibrosis, or cancer.  Mutation analysis revealed 2 different TERT gene sequence alterations. The A2537G in exon 9 (Y846C) and C2628G mutation in exon 10 (H876Q). Further analysis showed that the TERT Y846C mutation was inherited from the mother, whereas the TERT H876Q mutation was inherited from her father, indicating that patient 284.1 is a compound heterozygote for the 2 TERT gene mutations (Figure 1A). Both TERT gene mutations result in a significantly reduced telomerase activity after transfection into WI-38 VA-13 cells to 10% (P < .001) and 50% (P < .001) of normal (Figure 2A), whereas the cotransfection of the 2 mutants results in a telomerase activity of 38% (P = .004; Figure 2B).  Telomere length in peripheral blood cells from patient 284.1 was very short, below the 1st percentile of normal and so were those measured in her mother (284.2) and in one of her uncles (284.4), both of whom carry the TERT Y846C mutation. Telomere length in her father (284.3) heterozygous for the TERT H876Q mutation was between the 1st and 5th percentile of normal (Figure 2C).  In conclusion, we have identified 3 novel and 1 recurrent TERT gene mutation in 2 families who were thought to have sporadic DC and idiopathic aplastic anemia. All 4 mutations are hypomorphic mutations, impairing, but not eliminating telomerase activity. Homozygous hypomorphic TERT mutations have recently been found to cause disease in 2 consanguineous families.12 Here we demonstrate that in a nonconsanguineous family compound heterozygosity for TERT can cause disease and that the involvement of TERT in the pathogenesis of DC is probably more complex than initially anticipated. Our data indicate that in compound heterozygosity or homozygosity for hypomorphic TERT mutations the mutant alleles are codominant and suggest that severity of telomerase dysfunction and the inheritance of short telomeres determine the clinical phenotype and onset of disease. Codominant inheritance has also been found in one family with 2 hypomorphic TERC gene mutations,13 whereas compound heterozygosity or homozygosity for TERC or TERT null mutations have never been reported, suggesting that in humans, in contrast to mice, biallelic TERC or TERT null mutations are probably not compatible with life. The consideration that both sides of the family may be affected even in nonconsanguineous families might have important implications for the patient in the selection of a potential sibling donor as well as for the prognosis and management of other family members carrying one or 2 of the identified gene mutations.
33||The current World Health Organization classification of melanocytic tumors recognizes four major melanoma subtypes based on clinicopathologic features but with a very little prognostic relevance. Among them, acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM) has distinct epidemiologic and clinicopathologic features. Studies with comparative genomic hybridization have demonstrated that ALMs are characterized as having a high frequency of amplifications in small genomic regions.1 Some of these amplifications contain genes involved in oncogenesis and tumor progression, such as cyclin D1 (CCND1) at 11q13 and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT ) at 5p15.33.2 In a series of 43 formalin-fixed and paraffinembedded samples of infiltrating ALM, we have studied CCND1 and TERT gene status by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). For CCND1, the Fig 1. Urgency rating by urgent access clinic attending dermatologist categorized by diagnostic accuracy of referring providers. J AM ACAD DERMATOL VOLUME 71, NUMBER 4 Letters 839 commercially available probe LSI Cyclin D1/CEP 11 (Vysis; Abbott Molecular, Des Plaines, IL) was used. For TERT, noncommercial FISH probes using bacterial artificial chromosomes were developed and MCTP1 gene was used as chromosome control, as previously described.3 Gene amplifications were considered when the ratio between gene copy number and centromere or chromosome control copy number was greater than 2. FISH results were correlated with clinicopathologic parameters. The main clinicopathologic features of the cohort collected at diagnosis and their relationship with overall survival (OS) are expressed in Table I. Overall, the median follow-up period was 30 months (mean: 33.98; range: 1-161). CCND1 gene amplifications were found in 10 cases (23.3%) with a median CCND1-to-CEP11 ratio of 4.16 and TERT gene amplifications were detected in 9 cases (20.9%), with a median TERT-to-MCTP1 ratio of 3.10. CCND1 and TERT amplifications were mutually exclusive. Fig 1 shows a FISH image of an ALM harboring TERT gene amplification. In univariate survival analysis, TERT amplifications significantly reduced OS (P ¼ .025), while the patients with CCND1 amplifications had no significant differences in OS (P ¼.987) (see Table I). In multivariate survival analysis, Breslow index and TERT amplifications retained significance for OS (P ¼ .006; hazard ratio [HR] 9.20; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.90-44.59 and P ¼ .019; HR 4.63; 95% CI 1.29-16.62, respectively). In this preliminary study, we are reporting the prognostic value of TERT gene amplification evaluated by FISH in a series of ALMs. TERT is a gene encoding for the catalytic subunit of telomerase reverse transcriptase. Gene amplification is the most frequent mechanism for TERT activation, promoting cell survival and proliferation. However, the prognostic relevance of TERT amplification has only been proved in non-small cell lung carcinomas, to date.4 Recently, recurrent somatic mutations in the TERT promoter region have been described in some cancers, including melanomas. They could represent an additional potential mechanism of TERT activation, different from the well-recognized TERT copy number gains. In fact, a more recent study has demonstrated that TERT promoter mutations are uncommon in ALMs.5 These results are consistent with the supposed relation of these mutations with the UV light exposure and supports the evidence that melanomas may show different pathogenesis depending on body site and levels of sun exposure.1 Interestingly, we found TERT and CCND1 gene amplifications in different ALM subsets, and they were mutually exclusive in accordance with previous studies.2 This fact suggests that ALM may have different pathways of oncogenesis. Further studies including a larger number of cases are needed to confirm our results.  Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein enzyme complex that adds telomeric repeats to the ends of chromosomes. The core telomerase components are the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) catalytic subunit, and the telomerase RNA (TR) template subunit. In most cancers, telomerase is expressed at levels that are substantially higher than in normal cells. A known consequence of telomerase up-regulation which is considered to play a critical role in oncogenesis is maintenance of telomere length, and thus evasion by cancer cells of the normal limits on proliferation that are associated with the steady decrease in telomere length that accompanies proliferation of normal cells. It has also been suggested that telomerase up-regulation confers other advantages on cancer cells independent of its enzymatic activity. The mechanisms responsible for up-regulation of telomerase in cancer are incompletely understood. Here we review evidence suggesting that this frequently results from increased copy number of the genes encoding telomerase components. The TERT gene is located at human chromosome band 5p15.33, and the telomerase RNA component (TERC) gene that encodes TR is at 3q26.3. Chromosomal gains and gene amplifications involving chromosome arms 5p and 3q are among the most frequent in human tumors. Increased TERT and TERC gene dosage has been detected frequently in a variety of human cancers, and clonal evolution of cells with increased TERT or TERC copy number has been observed, suggesting a growth advantage in cells with increased TERT or TERC gene dosage. (Cancer Sci 2008; 99: 1092–1099) Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein enzyme complex that adds telomeric repeats to the ends of chromosomes.(1) The active human telomerase enzyme is composed of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), human telomerase RNA (hTR) and dyskerin.(2) hTERT (encoded by the TERT gene) is the catalytic reverse transcriptase component(3), hTR (encoded by the TERC gene) serves as the RNA template for the addition of telomeric repeats(4) and dyskerin (encoded by the DKC1 gene) is an RNA binding protein.(5) Mutations in any of these components may result in dyskeratosis congenita, a human disease syndrome associated with short telomeres (reviewed in Kirwan et al.(6)).  Telomerase activity has been detected in more than 85% of human tumors(7) whereas in normal human somatic cells it is either undetectable or present at low levels. In normal cells, telomeres shorten with every cell division, and this eventually results in senescence, a state characterized by permanent withdrawal from the cell division cycle. The increased telomerase activity found in cancers prevents telomere shortening, and allows cancer cells to escape the normal limits on cellular proliferation (reviewed in Colgin et al.(8)). When exogenous hTERT is expressed in normal cells, telomere shortening is prevented, and immortalization may occur.(9,10) Furthermore, inhibition of telomerase activity leads to senescence or apoptosis of tumor cells(11–13) indicating that telomerase activity is required for their long-term viability. Up-regulation of telomerase activity resulting in telomere length maintenance is therefore thought to be critical for oncogenesis. There is evidence, however, that TERT can also promote cell proliferation independently of the telomere-lengthening enzymatic activity of telomerase. For example, mouse TERT (mTERT) overexpression in mouse skin stimulates the proliferation of hair-follicle stem cells and facilitates robust hair growth; this effect is independent of telomerase activity because mTERT overexpression in mice that lack the RNA component results in the same effect.(14)  In view of the observations that hTR is ubiquitously expressed,(4,15) whereas hTERT is expressed only in telomerase-positive cells(3) and that expression of exogenous hTERT alone can immortalize normal human cells,(9,10) abundance of hTERT was previously thought to be the sole limiting factor for telomerase activity. However, evidence is increasing in support of the notion that hTR levels can also be limiting for telomerase activity. For example, overexpression of both hTERT and hTR substantially increased telomerase activity, whereas overexpression of either hTR or hTERT alone induced telomerase activity to a lesser extent.(16) The consequences for telomerase activity of overexpression of the other known telomerase component, dyskerin, are currently unknown, and there is no information available to indicate whether availability of this subunit is also limiting.  Changes in the copy number (gains and losses) of whole chromosomes or chromosome arms have been observed in a large number of human tumors (reviewed in Rooney et el.(17)). The chromosome arms that are most frequently gained include 8q (27.7% of tumors), 1q (25.1%), 7q (23.1%), 7p (21.5%), 17q (18.5%), 3q (16.4%), 20q (15.5%) and 5p (13.2%).(17) TERT has been mapped to chromosome 5 at 5p15.33(18) and TERC has been mapped to chromosome 3 at 3q26.3;(19) that is, both the TERT and TERC genes are located in regions frequently involved in chromosomal gains. The gene encoding dyskerin, DKC1, is located on Xq28, a region that is also known to be involved in amplification or chromosome gains in cancer cells.(17,20) However, there is no information available about whether the DKC1 gene itself is amplified in human cancer.  Gene amplification refers to the situation where there is an array of copies of a restricted region of a chromosome(21) and the region of the chromosome that becomes amplified is referred to as the ‘amplicon’. Gene amplification is common in human cancers and is considered to be one of the mechanisms of oncogene activation. Both the TERT and TERC gene loci are located on chromosome regions that are frequently amplified in human cancers. For example, chromosome 5p is often amplified in neuroblastoma, lung cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCC-HN), carcinoma of the cervix, medulloblastoma and osteosarcoma.(20,22,23) Amplifications involving 3q have been consistently detected in ovarian carcinoma,(24) carcinoma of the cervix, lung cancer and SCC-HN (reviewed in Knuutila et al.(20)).  This present study reviews the evidence that the gene dosage of TERT and TERC are often increased in human tumors. It should be noted that most studies reviewed here do not distinguish between chromosomal gain and gene amplification. Nevertheless, the outcome for the cell could be similar: both lead to an increase in gene dosage. We propose that increased TERT and TERC gene dosage may promote oncogenesis both through telomerase enzyme activity and possibly in activity-independent ways. The possible clinical implications are also discussed. Increased TERT copy number in cancer  Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and Southern blot analysis using probes containing TERT sequences or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers specific for TERT have demonstrated copy number increases of the TERT gene in multiple tumors or immortalized cell lines (Table 1). For example, FISH analysis using a probe that covered the genomic region encoding TERT together with a specific sequence at 5q31 as a marker probe detected two TERT gene copies located on band 5p15.33 and a 1:1 ratio of TERT/5q31 signal in normal cells. However, only 5 of 26 human tumor cell lines from different origins and 28 of 58 human primary tumors carried two TERT and two 5q31 marker copies. The remainder of the cell lines and primary tumors had more than two copies of TERT and a TERT/5q31 ratio ≥1.(25) Some of these (50% of cell lines and 22% of primary tumors) displayed 3–4 TERT copies/cell(25) while 31% of cell lines and 30% of human primary tumors had ≥5 copies of TERT per cell.(25)  Table 1.

For example, PCR analysis using primer sets specific for TERT and control sequences on 5q (5qSTS) detected a TERT/5qSTS ratio that ranged from 0.1 to 17.6 in 36 central nervous system (CNS) embryonal tumors whereas a mean ratio of 1.02 (ranging from 0.99 to 1.12) was detected in eight normal subjects.(26) In this study, 42% of CNS embryonal tumors had a TERT/5qSTS ratio ≥2.17 and were considered to have TERT amplification.(26)  In various studies, it was found that 25–31% of the cell lines examined had ≥5 TERT gene copies/cell in ≥40% of the cells. These included cell lines derived from neuroblastomas (Lan2, Lan5 and SHEP1) and carcinomas of breast (578T), cervix (HeLa and CaSki) and lung (H125, U1285, U1752, SHP77/97, H1688, Colo677/97, H446/97, BEN and H209).(25,27,28) Cell lines derived from bladder and epidermal carcinomas (5637 and A431) were reported to have ≥3 copies of hTERT per cell.(18) In primary tumors, increased TERT copy number has been detected in neuroblastomas (12%), CNS embryonal tumors (42%), hepatocellular carcinomas (22%) and cancers of the lung (30–63%), cervix (24–30%), breast (26%) and colon (48%) (Table 1). In addition, FISH analysis revealed 2–60 copies of TERT in leukemic cells.(29) It is worth noting that the threshold beyond which the TERT gene is considered to have increased copy number or to be amplified varies between studies. For example, using FISH analysis, Palmqvist et al. defined increased TERT copy number as ≥3 TERT copies/cell in ≥20% of the cells and detected 48% of 64 colorectal tumor samples that had increased TERT copy number.(30) In contrast, using the same technique, Zhang et al. defined TERT amplification as ≥5 TERT copies/cell in ≥20% of the cells and scored 24–30% of primary tumors as having TERT amplification.(25,27)  It is possible that the different thresholds for detection of TERT amplication may explain why some of the above-mentioned studies showed a correlation between increased TERT copy number and hTERT mRNA expression, while others showed no association.(30–32) For example, in a colorectal cancer study that used a low threshold (≥3 copies of TERT per cell in ≥20% of the cells), hTERT mRNA expression did not correlate with TERT gene dosage.(30) Alternatively, the discrepancy between TERT copy number and expression levels could be due to the different origins of the tumors and/or cell types. Observations from our laboratory are consistent with the latter explanation. We have identified increased TERT copy number in hTERT-immortalized human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) and in hTERT-immortalized human foreskin fibroblasts. Increased TERT copy number correlated with hTERT mRNA and protein expression in hTERT immortalized HMECs(33) but not in hTERT immortalized human foreskin fibroblasts (Cao et al. unpublished, 2007). Another possible explanation for the lack of correlation between amplification and hTERT expression is that the amplicon might contain an incomplete copy of the gene. Finally, hTERT expression has been shown to be regulated at multiple levels involving transcription, alternative splicing, translation and post-translational events (for reviews, see Horikawa et al.(34) and Ducrest et al.(35)) which provides additional potential explanations for why TERT gene dosage does not always correlate with hTERT expression.  Similarly, no consistent correlation between TERT copy number and telomerase activity has been observed. While Zhang et al.(25) and Saretzki et al.(28) reported a correlation between TERT gene dosage and telomerase activity in different cell lines and primary tumors, Palmqvist's study of colorectal primary tumor samples(30) and our studies of hTERT-immortalized HMECs(33) and human foreskin fibroblasts (Cao et al. unpublished, 2007) did not observe any correlation between TERT gene copy number and telomerase activity. This lack of correlation may be explained by the observation that telomerase is an enzyme complex composed of multiple components and the evidence (discussed below) that the levels of two of these components (hTERT and hTR) are limiting for telomerase activity. It should be noted that most of the published studies on increased TERT gene copy number have not investigated hTR levels. It is possible that hTR levels may limit telomerase activity in some tumors where increased TERT copy number does not correlate with telomerase activity. Our observation that hTR levels limit telomerase activity in mammary epithelial cells with TERT amplification(33) supports this possibility.  In various types of tumors, increased TERT gene copy number has been found to have clinical and prognostic correlates. For example, Zhu et al. showed that lung cancer patients with TERT amplification had poorer recurrence-free survival.(36) In hepatocellular carcinomas, hTERT amplification was found to be associated with poorly differentiated histopathology, which would be expected to correlate with poor outcome.(31) In melanomas, increased TERT copy number was significantly associated with the melanoma subtypes and locations of metastases. For example, increased TERT gene dosage was abundant in superficial spreading primary melanomas, subcutaneous metastases and malignant effusion-derived cells, but was completely absent or very rare in cells from primary nodular melanomas and brain, bone and lymph node metastases.(32) Increased TERC copy number in cancer  Like TERT, increased copy number of the TERC gene has been found in many tumor samples and immortalized cell lines by techniques such as FISH and Southern blot analysis using probes containing the TERC sequence (Table 2). Using TERC sequence as the probe in FISH analysis, Soder et al. detected more than 10 TERC DNA signals per nucleus in 4/73 carcinomas of the cervix, head and neck, and lung, and 29/30 (97%) of SCC-HN and cervical carcinomas had more than two copies of TERC per cell.(19) Southern blot analysis using 17 probes spanning chromosome 3q located an amplicon within band 3q26 which included the TERC gene, supporting TERC as a potential amplification target in tumors of the cervix, ovary and lung.(24)  Table 2.

The most frequent increased TERC copy number pattern was 2-2-3 (copy number of CEP7-CEP3-hTR). One case showed high-level amplification of TERC (>20 copies) while the two centromere probes were still diploid.(40) Seven of 12 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1/CIN2 lesions that progressed to CIN3 carried extra copies of TERC (and all matched CIN3 lesions had extra copies of TERC), whereas 0/10 non-progressing CIN1/CIN2 lesions carried extra copies of TERC.(41) Even more strikingly, extra copies of TERC were detected in 4/12 (33%) cytologically normal Pap smears from women who later developed CIN3 or cervical carcinomas (only 1–3 years after the normal Pap smears).(41) These results suggest that the detection of additional copies of the TERC gene in routinely collected Pap smears might be able to serve as an early and specific marker to identify lesions with a high progression risk.  Although FISH analysis using CEP7-CEP3-hTR probes in routinely collected Pap smears facilitated the visualization of extra copies of TERC in a single cell, the threshold for determining whether the TERC copy number increase in the cell population is clinically significant needs careful definition. For example, using a threshold of ≥5% of cells with multiple TERC signals and/or at least one observed cell with six or more TERC signals, no normal Pap smears were positive, but changing the threshold to ≥1% of cells with multiple TERC signals and/or at least one observed cell with five or more TERC signals, resulted in 2/13 (15.4%) cytologically normal Pap smears being positive.(40) The clinical outcomes were not known in this study, and it would be of great interest to determine whether the two women, whose smears were positive when the lower threshold was used, later developed high-grade lesions.  A correlation between TERC gene copy number and hTR expression level was observed in lung cancer(37) and leukemia(29) but not in melanoma.(32) No other studies have investigated the correlation between TERC gene copy number and hTR expression. Potential explanations for the non-correlation between TERT gene dosage and hTERT expression discussed before also apply to hTR. Like hTERT expression, hTR expression is regulated at multiple levels (reviewed Cairney et al.(42)), so a simple correlation between TERC gene dosage and hTR expression should not be expected.  Interestingly, 5 out of 50 (10%) cell cultures from melonomas displayed increased copy number of both TERT and TERC, although it is not clear whether this can happen in the same cell.(32) Extra copies of TERT and TERC are both observed in leukemic cells, but it cannot be ascertained from the publication whether extra copies of both genes were observed in the same samples.(29) None of the other publications reviewed here appear to have investigated the copy number of both genes, but evidence from separate studies indicates that TERT and TERC are both frequently amplified in lung and cervical carcinomas (Tables 1 and 2). Given the recent evidence that TERT and TERC gene products are both limiting for telomerase activity, it would be of considerable interest to know how frequently both genes are amplified in the same tumor or cell. Clonal overgrowth of cells with TERC or TERT amplification  Overgrowth of cells carrying additional copies of TERC appears to occur within cervical carcinomas.(40,41) Heselmeyer-Haddad et al. observed that in many instances cells with extra copies of TERC were located next to each other and this clustering increased with advanced dysplasia.(40,41) It is possible that cells carrying extra copies of TERC have a growth advantage, which eventually results in a cervical carcinoma cell population in which the majority of the cells are positive for TERC amplification. It is not clear whether TERC amplification correlates with hTR expression or telomerase activity in this context, and the mechanism of the putative promotion of cell growth by TERC amplification in cervical carcinomas awaits further investigation.  Our data indicate that a clone of cells with TERT amplification can overgrow all other cells in an in vitro cell population. Four independent hTERT-immortalized mass cultures (B80-TERT1, 2, 3a and 3b) were obtained by transfecting HMECs with an hTERT expression plasmid.(43) Extensive amplification of the TERT transgene in B80-TERT1 cells was detected by FISH analysis of metaphase spreads using a probe containing full-length hTERT cDNA or a 650 bp N-terminal hTERT probe. A similar pattern of TERT amplification was observed in every metaphase (Fig. 1), indicating that this immortalized cell line has become clonal even though it was originally established as a mass culture. FISH analysis detected a different pattern of TERT amplification in another cell line (B80-TERT3b), and it had also become clonal because every metaphase had the same pattern.(33) These observations suggest that cells with TERT amplification may have acquired a growth advantage.

Fluorescein-avidin detection of hTERT is shown in green. DAPI staining of the nucleus is shown in blue. Top and bottom panels are two representative images from the whole cell population. hTERT and hTR roles beyond telomerase activity  As noted above, increased TERT copy number in various tumors or cell lines does not always correlate with telomerase activity. A similar situation may also apply to increased TERC copy number. This could indicate that, at least in some tumors, the increases in copy number are simply random changes that reflect the genetic instability seen in cancers. Another potential explanation is that increased hTERT and hTR expression may promote carcinogenesis through a mechanism independent of the telomere-lengthening catalytic activity of telomerase.  Evidence that telomerase may promote tumorigenesis in ways beyond telomere length maintenance has been reviewed elsewhere (for example, see reference,(44)). Some of the evidence suggesting that specific telomerase components can have pro-oncogenic functions beyond their contribution to telomerase enzyme activity is as follows. hTERT has been shown to promote cell survival and proliferation in human breast cancer PMC42 cells; this effect was independent of its telomere-lengthening catalytic activity because an hTERT mutant (D788N) that lacks telomerase catalytic activity had a similar pro-survival effect.(45) An independent study showed that a catalytically inactive dominant-negative mutant of hTERT antagonized p53-induced apoptosis as efficiently as wild-type hTERT.(46) A third study has shown that hTERT protects against Bcl-2–dependent apoptosis, and that a dominant negative catalytically inactive mutant of hTERT had a similar antiapoptotic effect.(47) This antiapoptotic effect of hTERT that is independent of its catalytic activity was observed in three different human cancer cell lines: MCF7 breast cancer cells, M14 melanoma cells, and HCT116 colon cancer cells. Furthermore, hTERT protected against Bcl-2–dependent apoptosis independently of p53, because overexpression of hTERT antagonized apoptosis induced by a Bcl-2 inhibitor both in HCT116 p53+/+ and HCT116 p53–/– cells.(47)  A role for TERT independent of telomerase activity has also been demonstrated in mouse stem cells.(14) Conditional expression of mTERT in mouse skin epithelium caused activation of quiescent stem cells in the hair follicle and a rapid transition from the resting phase (telogen) to the active phase of the hair follicle cycle (anagen).(14) Induction of anagen by mTERT overexpression facilitated robust hair growth, regardless of whether mTR was expressed or not.(14) Furthermore, a catalytically inactive mTERT mutant (D702A) had a similar hair growth promoting effect compared to wild-type mTERT.(48)  It is also possible that hTR may have a function independent of its role as the template for telomere lengthening. Kedde et al. showed that inhibition of hTR expression in a number of different human cells triggered a rapid growth arrest which was associated with p53 and CHK1 activation.(49) Moreover, the rapid growth arrest resulting from hTR inhibition was independent of hTERT because a similar growth arrest and ATR activation was observed in a cell line (GM847) expressing no hTERT.(49) Both hTERT and hTR can be limiting for telomerase activity  Following the cloning of hTERT in 1997(3,50–52), it was shown that hTERT levels can be limiting for telomerase activity. hTERT expression is often undetectable in normal telomerase-negative cells, whereas hTR is expressed at detectable levels. It was shown that introduction of hTERT expression constructs into normal human cells induced telomerase activity, resulting in telomere length maintenance, escape from senescence, and extension of proliferative lifespan.(9,10,53) It was therefore deduced that hTERT levels are limiting, and that the other telomerase components must be expressed at sufficient levels. Studies in mice also supported the limiting role of TERT. For example, forced expression of mTERT in cardiac muscle in mice was sufficient to induce telomerase activity, resulting in hyperplasia and hypertrophy of cardiac myocytes.(54)  It has recently become clear that hTR is also limiting for telomerase activity and telomere maintenance (reviewed in Cairney et al.(42)). Early clues included the observation that hTR expression is upregulated in telomerase-positive immortal cell lines in comparison to telomerase-negative mortal cell strains.(3,4) Moreover, it has been observed that hTR levels are substantially elevated in a wide variety of human tumors.(55–59) Evidence that telomerase RNA levels may also be limiting in chicken cells is provided by the observation that oncogenic strains of Marek's disease virus (MDV) but not non-oncogenic strains encode a viral form of telomerase RNA (vTR), that shares 88% homology to chicken telomerase RNA.(60) MDV carrying both copies of vTR promoted malignant T cell lymphomagenesis in chickens, whereas mutants of the oncogenic strain of MDV lacking one or both copies of vTR were impaired in their ability to induce T cell lymphomas.(61)  Direct evidence that hTR levels are limiting for telomerase activity was published recently by Lingner and colleagues, who showed that concomitant overexpression of hTERT and hTR in several human cell lines resulted in higher levels of telomerase activity compared to hTERT or hTR overexpression alone.(16) It can therefore be concluded that hTERT and hTR levels both limit telomerase activity in these cell lines. hTR levels often become upregulated following transduction of normal cells with an hTERT expression construct(33,62), which probably explains why TERT levels alone were previously regarded as limiting. We also identified an hTERT-immortalized cell line in which hTR up-regulation was minimal.(33) In this latter cell line, transduction by an hTR expression plasmid resulted in a large increase in telomerase activity and telomere lengthening. The reason that hTR levels are upregulated in response to hTERT overexpression most likely includes stabilization of hTR by binding to TERT(62), but there are other aspects of the mechanism that are currently unexplained.(33)  Further evidence that hTR is limiting for telomerase activity comes from the observation that TERC is haploinsufficient in both humans and mice. Dyskeratosis congenita is a human syndrome characterized by abnormally short telomeres and premature proliferative exhaustion in tissues such as the bone marrow, and may be associated with mutations in various genes including TERC (reviewed in Kirwan et al.(6)). Although telomerase levels are insufficient to completely prevent telomere shortening in normal human cells, highly proliferative tissues such as the bone marrow require normal levels of telomerase activity to maintain an adequate proliferative capacity. It appears that the TERC mutations associated with dyskeratosis congenita reduce telomerase activity via haploinsufficiency rather than by a dominant negative mechanism.(63) Studies in mouse knockout models also suggest that this gene is haploinsufficient.(64,65) Conclusions  On the basis of the evidence that the levels of both TERT and TERC are limiting for telomerase activity and that the copy number of these genes is frequently increased in cancers by chromosomal gains or by amplification, we propose that increased TERT and/or TERC gene dosage is an important mechanism for upregulation of telomerase activity in human cancer. Interestingly, transduction of normal cells with hTERT expression constructs may result in upregulation of endogenous hTR expression, by mechanisms which are incompletely understood. Very little is currently known about changes in expression of the other known telomerase subunit, dyskerin. More extensive surveys will be required to determine how common increased dosage of TERT and TERC is across a wider range of tumors, and further studies are also required to determine whether dosage of both genes is frequently increased in the same tumors. It is also possible that the increased copy number of genes encoding telomerase components has prooncogenic effects in addition to the ability of telomerase to synthesize telomeric repeats, prevent telomere shortening, and permit cells to escape from senescence. Detection of TERT and/or TERC amplification may have useful applications in cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Realization of this potential will require robust definition of what constitutes a biologically significant increase in TERT or TERC copy number, and more extensive studies of the clinical outcome in patient cohorts.  Telomerase activation through the induction of its catalytic component TERT is essential in carcinogenesis. The regulatory mechanism and clinical significance underlying cancer-specific TERT expression have been extensively investigated in various human malignancies, but little is known about these in Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), an aggressive neuroendocrine skin tumor. Here we addressed these issues by determining TERT promoter mutations, gene amplification, mRNA expression and association with clinical variables in MCC. TERT mRNA was expressed in 6/6 MCC cell lines and 41 of 43 tumors derived from 35 MCC patients. Telomerase activity was detectable in all 6 cell lines and 11 tumors analyzed. TERT promoter mutations were identified in 1/6 cell lines and 4/35 (11.4%) MCC cases. The mutation exhibited UV signature and occurred in sun-exposed areas. Increased TERT gene copy numbers were observed in 1/6 cell lines and 11/14 (79%) tumors, and highly correlated with its mRNA expression (r = 0.7419, P = 0.0024). Shorter overall survival was significantly associated with higher TERT mRNA levels in MCC patients (P = 0.032). Collectively, TERT expression and telomerase activity is widespread in MCC, and may be attributable to TERT promoter mutations and gene amplification. Higher TERT expression predicts poor patient outcomes.  Keywords: Gene amplification, Merkel cell carcinoma, MCV, Promoter mutations, Telomerase, TERT Go to: INTRODUCTION Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), a neuroendocrine skin malignancy, is believed to originate from intraepidermal Merkel cells and predominantly occurs in the elderly population or immunocompromised individuals [1-4]. Although rare, the annual incidence of MCC has significantly increased in last decades [1-4]. Moreover, MCC is aggressive and has a mortality rate up to 33%, higher than that of any other skin tumors including malignant melanoma [3-5]. Immunosuppression, ultraviolet (UV) irradiation and infection of Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV) have been proposed to contribute to the development of MCC [3-5], however, our current understanding of the disease pathogenesis remains limited. Clearly, profound insights into the MCC pathophysiology are required to develop novel therapeutic strategies for the management and outcome improvement of MCC patients.  Telomerase is a RNA-dependent DNA polymerase responsible for lengthening telomere and silent in most normal human cells with a limited life-span [6-10]. It is well established that activation of telomerase is an essential step in malignant transformation, and by stabilizing telomere length, telomerase confers transformed cells an infinite proliferation potential [6-10]. Indeed, numerous clinical observations have shown that telomerase activity is detectable in up to 90% of human malignancies [6-8]. Mechanistically, induction of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) expression, the catalytic component of telomerase, is a key event activating telomerase [6, 9]. Thus, how cancer-specific TERT expression is achieved has long been an important issue in cancer research, but remains incompletely understood. The accumulated evidence has suggested that genetic factors play an important part in regulating TERT expression. We previously showed that TERT gene was frequently targeted for amplification in carcinogenesis, which contributed to telomerase activation in human malignancies [11, 12]. It has also been shown that certain single nucleotide polymorphisms increase cancer risk by up-regulating TERT expression and telomerase activity [13]. More recently, somatic TERT promoter mutations namely C228T and C250T have been identified as novel gain-of-function genetic events in up to 80% of malignant melanoma and other kinds of cancer [14-25]. All these findings, not only provide insights into telomerase activation in carcinogenesis, but also reveal clinical significance of telomerase/TERT-related assessments in cancer diagnosis and outcome prediction. Furthermore, targeting telomerase or telomere maintenance has been suggested as a novel anti-cancer strategy [26, 27].  Despite numerous existing data on telomerase/TERT in various types of human malignancies, little is known about these in MCC, and there has been so far only been one published report showing that telomerase activity was detected in 4/4 tumor biopsies from 4 MCC patients and in 3 of 4 cultured MCC cells derived from the above patients [28]. That result indicates widespread telomerase activation in MCC, however, further studies on large cohorts of patients are required to corroborate the finding. Moreover, it is currently unclear how telomerase is activated and how TERT expression is induced in MCC, and whether there exists a relationship between TERT expression and clinical-pathological features of MCC. In the present study, we address these issues by determining TERT expression, promoter mutation, gene amplification, telomerase activity and their clinical-pathological implications in MCC.  Go to: RESULTS Telomerase activation and association with clinical variables were analyzed together with TERT expression, promoter mutation, and gene amplification using a series of 43 MCCs from 35 patients (Table (Table11 and Supplementary Table S1) and 6 MCC cell lines.  Table 1 Table 1 Summary of clinical features of 35 MCC patients TERT mRNA expression and telomerase activity in MCC-derived cell lines and tumors from patients with MCC  A previous study reported detectable telomerase activity in tumor biopsies derived from 4 MCC patients [28], whereas TERT mRNA expression in MCC has not been investigated so far. Therefore, we first determined levels of TERT mRNA and/or telomerase activity in 6 MCC cell lines and 43 tumors [33 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) and 15 frozen samples; both FFPE and frozen tumor samples were available from 5 patients] obtained from 35 patients with MCC (Table (Table11 and Supplementary Table S1). Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analyses demonstrated the presence of TERT mRNA at different abundances in all 6 examined MCC cell lines, and 15/15 frozen and 31/33 FFPE tumor specimens (Fig. 1A, C and D, Table Table22 and Supplementary Table S2 and S3). Thus, a total of 41 tumors derived from 34 MCC patients (34/35, 97%) expressed TERT mRNA. Consistent with TERT expression, telomerase activity was detected in all 6 cell lines and 11 MCC frozen tumors analyzed (Fig. 1B and E, Table Table22 and Supplementary Table S2). As expected, the cell lines exhibited higher telomerase activity than did MCC tumors (Fig. 1B and E, and Supplementary Table S2). In the activity assay, telomerase-positive HEK-293 cell-derived extract and its heat-treated counterpart were analyzed in parallel as positive and negative controls, respectively. In addition, adjacent normal skin tissues derived from a MCC patient was also included and demonstrated their absence of telomerase activity (data not shown).  Table 2 Table 2 Summary of TERT alterations and telomerase activation in MCC tumors and cell lines Figure 1 Figure 1 TERT mRNA expression and telomerase activity in MCC cell lines and tumors TERT promoter mutations in MCC  The above result reveals a widespread TERT expression and telomerase activation in MCC. Given the recent finding that the UV-related TERT promoter mutation, up-regulating TERT gene transcription, widely occurs in malignant melanoma and other skin cancers [16], we sought to ask whether this was also the case in MCC. TERT promoter sequencing was performed on 6 MCC cell lines and 43 tumor specimens from 35 patients with MCC. The mutation was found in 1/6 MCC cell lines and 5 tumors (MCCT_2a, MCCT_2b, MCCT_17; MCCT_24 and MCCT_29) derived from 4 patients (4/35, 11.4%) (Fig. (Fig.2,2, Table Table22 and Supplementary Table S1), revealing the involvement of this genetic event in the MCC pathogenesis, although the frequency was lower than that in malignant melanoma. The mutant cell line harbored a C250T. One patient (MCCT_2) had the C250T mutation in the tumors from both diagnosis and recurrence. The three remaining mutation-carrying tumors exhibited C250T, C228T and CC242-243TT, respectively. C250T was the major type of TERT promoter mutations identified in MCC, which is different from most reported malignancies. Of note, for 3 of 4 mutation-carrying tumors, the primary tumor was located in the face and the remaining one was at the temple. Both face and temple are UV-exposed areas in the body and there was a significant difference in TERT promoter mutations between tumors at these sun-exposed and other areas (P = 0.035, Fisher’s exact test).  Figure 2 Figure 2 TERT promoter mutations identified in tumors derived from patients with MCC The TERT gene amplification in MCC tumors  The TERT gene is localized in chromosomal region 5p15.33 whereas gains of this region are prevalent in MCC [12, 29, 30]. Because the TERT amplification was previously found in many kinds of cancer [11, 12], we examined TERT gene copy numbers in 6 MCC cell lines and 14 patient-derived frozen tumors using qPCR. Patients’ peripheral blood leukocytes and TERT-amplified HeLa cell line [12] were used as normal (2 copies/cell) and positive (5 copies/cell) controls, respectively. One of 6 cell lines was found to harbor 5 TERT copies/cell and the remaining 5 lines had normal numbers (Table (Table22 and Supplementary Table S2). Eleven of 14 examined MCC tumors exhibited increased TERT copies ranging from 3 to 12/cell, whereas 1 of them had only one TERT copy each cell, indicating its deletion (Supplementary Table S2). Normal TERT copy numbers were observed in 2 tumors (Supplementary Table S2). The presence of TERT amplification was not related to anatomic sites of MCC, which was different from the TERT promoter mutation.  Correlation between TERT mRNA levels and TERT gene amplification in MCC tumors  To see whether the TERT amplification plays a functional role in TERT mRNA expression, we made a correlation analysis between the TERT copy number and its mRNA level in 14 tumors. As shown in Fig. Fig.33 and Supplementary Table S2, higher TERT mRNA expression was significantly correlated with increased TERT copies in primary MCC tumors (r = 0.7419, P = 0.0024), suggesting a positive effect of the TERT amplification on gene transcription.  Figure 3 Figure 3 Positive correlation between TERT copy numbers and TERT mRNA abundance in MCC tumors Relationship of MCV with the TERT promoter mutation, gene amplification or mRNA expression  MCV is implicated in the pathogenesis of MCC [31], and we were thus interested in the relationship between MCV and the TERT promoter mutation and TERT expression. In our cohort, 3/6 (50%) MCC cell lines and 25/35 (71%) MCC tumors were MCV-positive (Table (Table11 and Supplementary Table S1 and S2). The one cell line with TERT promoter mutation was negative for MCV. Three of the 4 mutation-carrying MCC tumors were MCV-negative and one was MCV-positive (Supplementary Table S2 and S3). These results suggest that the TERT promoter mutation tends to occur in MCV-negative MCCs (mutations in MCV+ vs - cases: P = 0.0613, Fisher’s exact test). When both cell lines and patients were analyzed together, there was a significant difference in the mutation between tumors with and without MCV (P = 0.011, Fisher’s exact test). There was no difference in TERT mRNA expression either between MCV+ and – cell lines or patients’ tumors. We were unable to perform a correlation analysis on MCV status and TERT gene copies due to too few (only one) MCV-negative tumors.  Clinical relevance of the TERT promoter mutation, gene amplification and mRNA expression in MCC  Age at diagnosis, gender, tumor size, metastasis and recurrence were not associated with the TERT promoter mutation and gene amplification (Supplementary Table S4). However, higher TERT mRNA expression was more frequently observed in male patients (P = 0.047). In 24 evaluable MCC patients, lower levels of TERT mRNA expression in tumors were significantly associated with longer overall survival time [P = 0.032, Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test; Fig. Fig.44].  Figure 4 Figure 4 Significant correlation between the TERT mRNA level and overall survival in MCC patients Go to: DISCUSSION In the present study, we performed a comprehensive analysis on the genetic regulation of TERT expression and its clinical-pathological association in MCC. Our results demonstrate that (i) TERT expression and telomerase activity is highly prevalent in MCC; (ii) TERT promoter mutations are identified in > 10% of MCC, and most frequently occur at sun-exposed areas and MCV-negative tumors; (iii) The TERT gene amplification is widespread and positively correlated with TERT expression levels in MCC; and (iv) Higher levels of TERT mRNA expression are significantly associated with shorter survival time in MCC patients. These findings provide important insights into the regulatory mechanism underlying telomerase activation in MCC and may be implicated in future MCC management.  The recurrent TERT promoter mutations create de novo ETS binding motifs, thereby facilitating the TERT transcription and activating telomerase, and they have been identified in various types of human malignancies [19]. However, the mutation frequency varies substantially from cancer to cancer. They are widespread in melanoma, cutaneous base and squamous cell carcinoma, bladder and renal pelvic cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, glioblastoma and certain thyroid cancer, while rare or absent in prostate, lung, breast and digestive track cancer, and hematological malignancies [14-16, 18-21, 23]. In the present study, we identified the TERT promoter mutation in 1/6 MCC cell lines (16.7%) and 4/35 patients with MCC (11.4%), which suggests that it is not a rare genetic event in MCC. All the identified mutations, including C250T, C228T and CC242-243TT, lead to gain-of-function via the creation of an extra ETS binding motif [19]. However, the mutation profile observed in MCC is very unique. The C250T mutation was predominant in MCC (60%), which is in sharp contrast to almost all the reported human malignancies where C228T is much more prevalent [15, 16, 19, 25]. In addition, the CC242-243TT mutation, observed in 1/4 of MCC tumors, is rarely seen in other types of cancer (<4% and 0.5% in melanoma and bladder cancer, respectively). It will be interesting to probe what causes such a difference in the TERT promoter mutation pattern between MCC and other human malignancies. It should be pointed out, however, that we are unable to exclude potential sampling error and thus the result obtained from this cohort of 35 patients is unlikely conclusive. Further studies recruiting more MCC patients are required to confirm the present finding.  Up to 80% of malignant melanoma harbor TERT promoter mutations and UV irradiation was proposed to result in these mutagenic lesions [15, 16, 25]. UV irradiation is also closely associated with the pathogenesis of MCC, and our findings do support a potential link between the TERT promoter mutation and UV lesions. First, C to T and especially CC to TT alterations at the TERT promoter, observed in MCC, represent the hallmark of UV-induced DNA mutagenesis. Second, the TERT promoter mutation occurs exclusively in MCC tumors localized at face or temple, sun-exposed areas. These features were similarly observed in malignant melanoma and other skin cancers [15, 16, 25].  Compared to the TERT promoter mutation, the TERT amplification is more prevalent in MCC. We found that 11 of 14 examined MCC tumors (79%) harbored the increased TERT copy number. This result is consistent with previous cytogenetic and CGH data showing the frequent regional or whole arm gains of 5p where the TERT locus is localized [4, 29, 30]. Unlike the promoter mutation, the TERT amplification occurs in both sun-exposed and other areas, reflecting its irrelevance with UV irradiation [4, 29, 30]. Notably, there exists a highly positive correlation between the TERT gene copy number and its mRNA level, which indicates a functional impact of the TERT amplification on the TERT transcription in MCC. Taken together, the TERT gene amplification plays a significant role in telomerase activation during the development of MCC.  A number of oncogenic viruses target the TERT gene by de-repressing its transcription for telomerase activation [32, 33]. Because MCV is frequently detected in MCC and implicated in the disease pathogenesis, we are interested in a potential association between the virus infection and TERT promoter mutation or gene amplification. Intriguingly, the TERT promoter mutation tends to occur in MCV-negative tumors. This is similar to that observed in hepatocellular carcinomas where the TERT promoter mutation is significantly more frequent in patients without hepatitis virus B infection [18]. Owing to the limited number of patients, the relationship between the virus status and TERT amplification remains to be defined. It is currently unclear whether MCV, like other viruses, regulates TERT expression at the transcriptional level. SV40 was shown to activate telomerase in human mesothelial cells via its small T (sT) [34], and given a similar sT encoded by MCV, it could also be the case in the virus-positive MCC. Further experimental studies are required to answer this important question.  Clinical observations suggest that TERT promoter mutations may predict outcomes and associate with aggressive diseases in a number of cancer types [19]. In the present study, we identified 4 MCC patients with the TERT promoter mutation in their tumors, and the number is not sufficient to determine its prognostic or clinical power. Further investigations on a larger cohort of patients are required to address this issue. Nevertheless, a significant association between higher TERT expression and shorter patients’ survival observed in the present study indicates that TERT may serve as prognostic marker and be a therapeutic target for MCC.  In summary, the study presented here reveals a widespread TERT expression and telomerase activation in MCC. The TERT gene amplification and promoter mutation may significantly contribute to the de-repression of TERT transcription, whereas higher levels of TERT expression consequently contribute to poor patients’ outcomes. Moreover, given multi-biological activities of TERT/telomerase in cancer development and progression, [35] and telomerase-based cancer therapy as a novel anti-cancer strategy [26], it is worth of determining whether the combination of conventional therapeutic approaches with telomerase inhibitors is capable of improving treatment efficacy and survival in MCC patients.  Go to: MATERIALS AND METHODS Patient specimens and MCC cell lines  A total of 48 tumor specimens from 35 patients with MCC were collected and most of them (33/48) had been described in a recent report [36] (Table (Table11 and Supplementary Table S1). There were 20 female and 15 male patients, with a median age at diagnosis of 77 years (range 20 to 100). Out of the 48 tumors, 33 were obtained as FFPE samples and 15 were fresh-frozen. For 7 patients, matched pairs of primary and recurrent tumors were available. All these MCC specimens exhibited high tumor content with >80% tumor cells. The MCC diagnosis was based on histopathological and immunohistochemical examinations. All the patients were followed-up until March 2014 or until death. Detailed clinical and histopathological information is given in Supplementary Table S1. The study was approved by the local Ethics Committee at Karolinska Institutet.  Six MCC cell lines were studied. Three of them were MCV-positive and the remaining 3 were MCV-negative. The MCV-positive cell lines WaGa, MKL-1 and MKL-2 were kindly provided by Drs. Jürgen C. Becker (Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria), Nancy L. Krett (Northwestern University, Chicago, IL) and Roland Houben (University Hospital Würzburg, Würzburg, Germany), respectively. The MCV-negative MCC cell lines MCC13, MCC14/2 and MCC26 were purchased from CellBank Australia (Westmead, Australia). Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% (WaGa, MKL-1 and MKL-2) or 15% (MCC13, MCC14/2 and MCC26) fetal bovine serum, and 2 ml L-glutamine under 37 ºC / 95% air / 5% CO2.  DNA extraction, TERT promoter sequencing and TERT gene copy number determination  Genomic DNA was extracted from FFPE tissues and frozen tumors or cell lines using QIAmp DNA FFPE Tissue kit and Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen, Hildane, Germany), respectively. The two common mutations C228T and C250T in the TERT proximal promoter correspond to positions 124 and 146 bp upstream of the ATG site, while the CC242-243TT mutation was at 137 and 138 bp. The target region covering these mutations (from 214 bp to 22 bp upstream of the ATG site) were amplified using conventional PCR followed by Sanger sequencing as described [17]. The PCR was performed with the following primer pairs: 5′-CACCCGTCCTGCCCCTTCACCTT-3′ and 5′- GGCTTCCCACGTGCGCAGCAGGA-3′. The C228T, CC242-243TT and C250T mutations were verified by sequencing from both directions.  TERT gene copy numbers were quantified using qPCR with the primer pair described above. β-globin gene was PCR-amplified in parallel as a reference for normalization, using the primers 5′-TGTGCTGGCCCATCACTTTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACCAGCCA-CCACTTTCTGATAGG-3′ (reverse). TERT copy numbers in peripheral blood DNA (2 copies/cells) from MCC patients or normal individuals and HeLa cells (5 copies/cell), well-defined in our previous study,[12] were used as normal and positive controls, respectively. Two independent assays were performed and the TERT copy number was determined by mean Ct values from two independent assays.  RNA extraction and RT-qPCR for TERT mRNA expression  Total cellular RNA was extracted from frozen and FFPE specimens using mirVana miRNA isolation kit (Life Technology) and modified TriZol method, respectively [36]. qPCR was carried out using an ABI 7900HT Real time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) and Taq Man Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems) for TERT (Hs00972656_m1), ACTB (Hs01060665_g1) and 18S rRNA (Hs99999901_s1). Expression levels of TERT mRNA were calculated from threshold cycle values and normalized to 18S and ACTB values for frozen and FFPE tissues, respectively.  Telomerase activity assessment  Telomerase activity was determined using a TeloTAGGG Telomerase PCR ELISA kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). One microgram protein was used in each assay. Reaction mixtures with human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cell protein extracts and their heat-inactivated counterparts were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Telomerase activity was calculated from the absorbance at optical density (OD) OD450-OD690 and expressed as the folds of that in HEK-293 cells.  MCV detection  MCV detection was performed using PCR and/or immunohistochemistry [31, 36-38]. The detection of MCV status in all FFPE samples has been previously published [36], while all 15 frozen tumors were characterized in this study.  Statistical analyses  The Pearson correlation analysis was used to determine correlation between the TERT gene copy number and mRNA level. High and low TERT expression groups were defined by the median expression levels of the tumors analyzed. Differences in the TERT promoter mutation frequency and TERT mRNA expression between tumors with gender, clinical stage, tumor size, metastasis and MCV status were determined using Fisher's exact test. Overall survival was illustrated by Kaplan-Meier plots, and significance was calculated by log-rank (Mantel –Cox) test. All the tests were two-tailed and computed using Statistica 7.0 software (StatSoft, Tulsa, OK). P values of <0.05 were considered as statistically significant.
34||Sequencing studies have identified many recurrent coding mutations in human cancer genes; however, highly recurrent mutations involving regulatory regions have rarely been observed. Here we describe two independent mutations within the TERT core promoter that, when taken together, were observed in 71% (50 of 70) of melanomas and generate de novo consensus ETS binding motifs. Reporter assays showed that these mutations increase transcriptional activity from the TERT promoter by 2–4-fold. Examination of cancer cell lines derived from diverse tumor types revealed the same mutations in 16% (24 of 150) of cases, with preliminary evidence of elevated frequency in bladder and hepatocellular cancer cells. Thus, somatic mutations in regulatory regions of the genome may represent an important tumorigenic mechanism.  Systematic characterization of human cancer genomes has led to the discovery of a wide range of mutated genes that contribute to tumor development and progression. Most of the somatic mutations in tumors reside within the protein-coding regions of genes or at splice junctions. To determine whether tumor genomes harbor recurrent mutations outside of protein-coding regions, we systematically queried noncoding somatic mutations using published whole-genome sequencing data.  Analysis of whole-genome sequencing data from malignant melanomas (1, 2) revealed two somatic telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene promoter mutations in 17 of 19 (89%) cases examined. The average sequence coverage at the TERT promoter locus was 30-fold in normal samples and 60-fold in tumor samples (fig. S1A). Each of these promoter mutations resulted in a cytidine-to-thymidine transition at a dipyrimidine motif indicative of ultraviolet (UV) light–induced damage (chr5, 1,295,228 C>T and 1,295,250 C>T; hereafter termed C228T and C250T, respectively), and both mutations localized within 100 base pairs (bp) of the TERT transcriptional start site (TSS) (mean allelic fraction, 0.32; range, 0.07 to 0.55) (table S1). We validated these mutations by means of polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing tumor/normal sample pairs from both the discovery set (Fig. 1A and fig. S1, B and C) and an extension set of 51 additional melanoma tumor/normal sample pairs. Within this extension set, 33 tumors (65%) harbored one of the mutations. Moreover, the mutations were mutually exclusive in both the discovery and extension sets (P = 5.4 × 10−7, Fisher’s one-sided exact test). Two tumors with a C228T transition also contained an adjacent C>T transition (at position chr5, 1,295,229), which is indicative of a dinucleotide CC>TT transition. Together, these TERT promoter mutations were observed in 50 of 70 (71%; 95% confidence interval: 59 to 82%, Clopper-Pearson method) melanomas examined (Fig. 1B and table S1).  Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Identification of TERT promoter mutations in melanoma and cancer cell lines Both C228T and C250T generated an identical 11-bp nucleotide stretch (5′-CCCCTTCCGGG-3′) containing a consensus binding site for E-twenty-six (ETS) transcription factors (GGAA, reverse complement) within the TERT promoter region. Because ETS transcription factors may become activated through dysregulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) signaling, we hypothesized that these promoter mutations might augment gene expression. To test this hypothesis, we used a reporter assay system in which the relevant portion of the mutant or wild-type TERT core promoter was cloned upstream of the firefly luciferase gene (2). Here, we tested both a core promoter fragment (−132 to +5 relative to the TSS) and the full core promoter (−200 to +73). In comparison to the wild-type TERT promoter, both mutations conferred approximately two- to fourfold increased transcriptional activity in five distinct cell line contexts (Fig. 1C and fig. S1D). Thus, each mutation was capable of augmenting transcriptional activity from the TERT promoter.  To investigate whether similar TERT promoter mutations occur in other cancer types, we examined sequencing data from this locus in 150 cell lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) (3). Overall, 24 CCLE lines (16%) contained either C228T or C250T (mean allelic fraction, 0.61; range, 0.17 to 1.00) (table S1). An increased frequency in melanoma was again noted (five of six lines tested), with additional evidence suggesting possible heightened prevalence (>25%; one-sided 95% confidence interval) in bladder (three of three lines) and hepatocellular cancer cell lines (four of six lines) (Fig. 1D).  Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that these promoter mutations may function as driver events that contribute to oncogenesis through TERT dysregulation and undergo positive selection, at least in human melanoma. First, the TERT promoter mutations showed a combined frequency that exceeded those of BRAF and NRAS mutations, which activate known melanoma driver oncogenes (4, 5). In an analysis restricted to somatic mutations present at an allelic fraction of 0.2 or greater [to reduce artifacts of mutation calling (1)], the four most recurrent melanoma nucleotide substitutions included BRAF [chr7, 140,453,136 A>T (V600E)], NRAS [chr1, 115,256,529 T>C (Q61R)], and the TERT core promoter mutations C228T and C250T. Second, although highly recurrent, C228T and C250T occurred in a wholly mutually exclusive fashion. This suggests the possibility that the mutations might be functionally redundant. Third, the absence of other recurrent somatic mutations in the 3 kb upstream of the TERT transcription start site in the queried melanomas (1) coupled with the absence of the described TERT promoter mutations in 24 lung adenocarcinomas with comparably high somatic mutation rates (6) reduces the possibility that these recurrent TERT promoter mutations are solely due to an increased background mutation rate at this locus. Although the role of telomerase in tumorigenesis is well established, details regarding its dysregulation in cancer cells remain incompletely understood, particularly in melanoma (7). The TERT promoter mutations identified here may link telomerase gene regulation and tumorigenic activation in this malignancy. The high prevalence of C228T and C250T suggests that these TERT promoter mutations may comprise early genetic events in the genesis of melanoma and other cancer types. Although TERT expression alone is not sufficient to bypass oncogene-induced senescence, genomic TERT activation may potentiate mechanisms by which melanocytes achieve immortalization in the setting of oncogenic mutations (8). These results therefore suggest that renewed efforts to develop clinically effective telomerase inhibitors may be warranted.  At the same time, promoter mutations likely represent only one potential mechanism of TERT reactivation in a subset of human cancers. Indeed, recurrent chromosomal copy gains spanning the TERT locus have been described previously for several cancers, including melanoma (9, 10).  Highly recurrent somatic mutations within a cancer gene promoter region have not previously been described. Similarly, the de novo mutational generation of transcription factor binding motifs in tumor genomes was heretofore unknown, although an ETS transcription factor binding motif was previously associated with a single-nucleotide polymorphism insertion at the MMP-1 locus (11). Together, these findings raise the possibility that recurrent somatic mutations involving regulatory regions, in addition to coding sequences, may represent important driver events in cancer.  TERT Promoter Mutations in Familial and Sporadic Melanoma Susanne Horn,1,2 Adina Figl,1,2 P. Sivaramakrishna Rachakonda,1 Christine Fischer,3 Antje Sucker,2 Andreas Gast,1,2 Stephanie Kadel,1,2 Iris Moll,2 Eduardo Nagore,4 Kari Hemminki,1,5 Dirk Schadendorf,2 *† Rajiv Kumar1 *† Cutaneous melanoma occurs in both familial and sporadic forms. We investigated a melanoma-prone family through linkage analysis and high-throughput sequencing and identified a disease-segregating germline mutation in the promoter of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene, which encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase. The mutation creates a new binding motif for Ets transcription factors and ternary complex factors (TCFs) near the transcription start and, in reporter gene assays, caused up to twofold increase in transcription. We then screened the TERT promoter in sporadic melanoma and observed recurrent ultraviolet signature somatic mutations in 125 of 168 (74%) of human cell lines derived from metastatic melanomas, 45 of 53 corresponding metastatic tumor tissues (85%), and 25 of 77 (33%) primary melanomas. The majority of those mutations occurred at two positions in the TERT promoter and also generated binding motifs for Ets/TCF transcription factors. The identification of germline mutations that cosegregate with disease in cancerprone families often provides genetic and mechanistic insights into the more common, sporadically arising cancers. In a study of cutaneous melanoma, the most malignant skin cancer, we investigated a large pedigree with 14 related melanoma patients who were not carriers of germline mutations in CDKN2A or CDK4, two known melanoma genes (Fig. 1). Multipoint linkage analysis showed a possible 2.2-Mb linkage region on chromosome 5p with maximal logarithm of the odds ratio for linkage scores of 2.35 at rs1379917 and 2.45 at rs1968011. Target-enriched high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of the region was carried out on constitutional DNA from the four affected and four unaffected members of the family with an average coverage between 55- and 108-fold (table S1) (1). The HTS data revealed a single promoter variant, three intronic variants, and three nongene variants previously unknown and unique to the DNA sequences of the affected individuals (table S2). The disease segregating variants, seven in total, were validated by Sanger sequencing of DNA from the individuals sequenced by HTS and of DNA from additional unaffected members of the family. The new variants were also detected in an unaffected member (754, table S3), who was 36 years old and carried multiple nevi. DNA from affected individuals other than those sequenced by HTS was not available for testing. Of the seven unique variants identified, one variant (T>G), was located in the promoter at –57 base pairs (bp) from ATG translation start site of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT ) gene. The TERT gene encodes the catalytic reverse transcriptase subunit of telomerase, the ribonucleoprotein complex that maintains telomere length. The nucleotide change in the sequence CCTGAA>CCGGAA creates a new binding motif for Ets transcription factors, with a general recognition motif GGA(A/T). Beyond the general motif for Ets transcription factors, the familial mutation also generates a binding motif, CCGGAA, for the ternary complex factors (TCFs) Elk1 and Elk4 (2, 3). To exclude the possibility that the detected promoter mutation in TERT is a common germline variant, we screened germline DNA from 140 sporadic melanoma cases and 165 healthy controls, and none carried the variant. Screening of DNA from index cases from 34 Spanish melanoma families also did not show any mutations. No carriers were found in dbSNP and the 1000 Genomes databases (data available for 18 individuals were obtained from Ensembl). The familial mutation in the TERT promoter was in complete allelic linkage with a common polymorphism rs2853669 (G>A) at –246 bp upstream from the ATG start site (table S3). In previous work, this polymorphism was reported to disrupt an Ets binding site, and it was associated with low telomerase activity in patients with non– small cell lung cancer (4). In luciferase reporter gene assays, we found that the activity of constructs containing the mutation at –57 bp of the TERT promoter was increased 1.5-fold and 1.2- fold over the wild-type construct in Ma-Mel-86a and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells, respectively. A construct with both the TERT mutation and the variant allele of the rs2853669 polymorphism showed a 2.2-fold increase in promoter activity in Ma-Mel-86a and and 1.3-fold increase in HEK293 cells (mean from three measurements; details in supplementary text and fig. S1). The germline occurrence of the promoter mutation, creating an Ets/TCF motif, can result in modification of TERT expression in all tissues expressing Ets/TCF. Highest staining for the TCF Elk1 protein has been reported in female-specific tissues, such as ovary and placenta. The increased expression of TCF Elk1 protein in female-specific tissues may cause gender-related differences in 1 Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Center, Im Neuenheimer Feld 580, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany. 2 Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Essen, 45122 Essen, Germany. 3 Institute of Human Genetics, University of Heidelberg, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany. 4 Department of Dermatology, Instituto Valenciano de Oncologia, Valencia, Spain. 5 Center for Primary Health Care Research, Lund University, Malmö, Sweden. *To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Two affected members of the family developed several different types of cancer (marked with # in Fig. 1). One affected individual presented with ovarian cancer at age 27 and melanoma at age 30. Another individual was diagnosed with melanoma at age 20; later she developed ovarian cancer, renal cell carcinoma, bladder cancer, mammary carcinoma, and finally bronchial carcinoma, leading to her death at age 50. The mutation in the melanoma-prone family prompted us to screen melanoma cell lines derived from sporadic cases of metastatic melanoma. None of the cell lines carried the mutation detected in the family. However, we identified recurrent ultraviolet (UV)–signature mutations in the TERT core promoter in 74% (125 of 168) of the cell lines. The mutations were located within a 49-bp region starting from –100 bp upstream of the ATG start site (Table 1, Fig. 2, fig. S2, and table S4). There were two frequent mutations at –124 bp (G>A; C>T on opposite strand) and –146 bp (G>A); these mutations were mutually exclusive and occurred in 27 and 38% of cell lines, respectively. Two tandem GG>AA (CC>TT) mutations at positions –124/–125 bp and –138/–139 bp were observed at a frequency of 9%. The tandem mutation at positions –138/–139 bp could also be generated by a single-base mutation at –138 bp, because the base change at –139 bp has been reported as a rare polymorphism (rs35550267). The two most frequent single-base mutations as well as the two tandem mutations also result in the creation of Ets/TCF binding motifs. Mutations were confirmed in 45 of 53 (85%) available metastasized tumors corresponding to the cell lines. The somatic nature of the mutations was shown by the absence of mutations in corresponding DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells available from 23 patients. Somatic mutations in the TERT promoter were more frequent than the BRAF mutations (53%, 90 of 169), CDKN2A alterations (50%, 84 of 169), and NRAS mutations (23%, 38 of 169; fig. S3). The occurrence of concomitant mutations in the TERT promoter and BRAF was more frequent (47%) than by random chance (40%) with an odds ratio (OR) of 3.2 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3 to 8.2]. Concomitant mutations in TERT, BRAF, and CDKN2Awere observed in 30% of cell lines compared with the expected frequency of such occurrence of 9% (OR 5.6, 95% CI 2.4 to 13.8). The high recurrence and specificity of the TERT promoter mutations, together with the preliminary evidence from reporter assays that they have a functional effect on transcription, suggest that these mutations are driver rather than passenger events. Extensive functional studies will be required to validate this hypothesis. The TERT promoter mutations were also detected in 25 out of 77 (33%) paraffin embedded primary melanoma tumors (Table 1 and table S5) at –124 bp (7/77; 9%) and –146 bp (5/77; 7%). Four primary tumors carried the GG>AA tandem mutations at –124/–125 bp, and eight primary tumors carried the GG>AA tandem mutations at –138/–139 bp. Reduced sensitivity to detect mutations in paraffin-embedded primary tumors because of contaminating normal cells cannot be ruled out. Primary tumors harbored five additional mutations in the TERT promoter, which were not present in metastases, and those did not generate Ets/TCF binding motifs. We also screened DNA extracted from 25 melanocytic nevi and only one carried a mutation at –101 bp, which did not create an Ets/TCF motif. For both primary tumors and melanocytic nevi, matched normal control DNA was not available for testing. The TERT coding region has been reported to be somatically mutated in 1% of cancers (14 cancer types, 1271 unique samples) (6). Mutations creating Ets/TCF binding motifs in the TERT promoter in melanoma have not been described in earlier sequencing projects. TCFs are a subfamily of Ets transcription factors; two members of this subfamily, Elk1 and Elk4, are downstream targets of BRAF and regulate the expression of many genes (7–11). Conceivably, TCF may represent a link between telomerase activity and the frequent BRAF activating mutations in melanoma (fig. S4) (12, 13). Lastly, whether TERT promoter mutations occur in other cancer types remains to be determined. We did not detect these mutations in a screen of 22 esophageal squamous cell c  Reactivation of telomerase has been implicated in human tumorigenesis, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we report the presence of recurrent somatic mutations in the TERT promoter in cancers of the central nervous system (43%), bladder (59%), thyroid (follicular cell-derived, 10%) and skin (melanoma, 29%). In thyroid cancers, the presence of TERT promoter mutations (when occurring together with BRAF mutations) is significantly associated with higher TERT mRNA expression, and in glioblastoma we find a trend for increased telomerase expression in cases harbouring TERT promoter mutations. Both in thyroid cancers and glioblastoma, TERT promoter mutations are significantly associated with older age of the patients. Our results show that TERT promoter mutations are relatively frequent in specific types of human cancers, where they lead to enhanced expression of telomerase.

Reactivation or re-expression of telomerase is referred to be a widespread feature in human cancers, although the genetic basis remains poorly understood in many cancer types. Somatic mutations in the coding region of TERT (human telomerase reverse transcriptase) are infrequent in human tumours, but germline and somatic mutations in TERT promoter were recently found in a high percentage of human melanomas and human cancer cell lines1,2. Such mutations occurred in two hotspot positions, located  124 and  146 bp upstream from the ATG start site (  124 G4A and  146 G4A, C4T on opposite strand) and conferred enhanced TERT promoter activity1,2, by putatively generating a consensus binding site (GGAA) for ETS transcription factors within the TERT promoter region1,2. Our aim was to investigate whether the aforementioned TERT promoter mutations were present in cancer types other than melanoma, having for that matter screened 741 primary tumours from the thyroid, kidney, bladder, gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST), adrenal medulla (phaeochromocytomas) and central nervous system (CNS). Besides skin melanoma, we have also included ocular melanoma (not studied in the previous reports), benign lesions of the thyroid and skin and 58 human cancer-derived cell lines. Our results highlight TERT promoter mutations as frequent events in specific types of human cancers. Results TERT mutations in tumours and cell lines. Overall, TERT promoter mutations were found in 142 (19%) human tumour samples (Table 1; Fig. 1a) and 14 (24%) human cell lines (Fig. 1b; Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). The  124-bp mutation was the most frequent, being present in 99 cases, whereas the  146- bp mutation was present in 43 cases. The  124 G4A and  146 G4A mutations were found in a mutually exclusive fashion. Two tandem GG4AA mutations at positions  124/  125 and  138/  139 bp were observed in one cell line each (Supplementary Fig. S1 and Supplementary Table S1). TERT promoter mutations were not detected in normal thyroid tissue nor in benign lesions (nevi, thyroiditis, goitres and adenomas). No mutations were detected in 26 kidney cancers, 17 phaeochromocytomas and 36 GISTs. TERT mutations in melanoma. We have analysed both skin and ocular melanomas, a type of melanoma that was not previously studied1,2. TERT mutations were present in 16 out of 56 (29%) skin melanomas, but absent in the 25 ocular melanomas (Table 1). All the four skin melanoma-derived cell lines but none of the six ocular melanoma-derived cell lines harboured TERT mutations (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table S1). Ten out of 16 (63%) skin melanomas with TERT mutation also harboured the BRAFV600E mutation, whereas the BRAF mutation was present in 9 out of 38 (24%) melanomas without TERT mutation (P ¼ 0.01, Fisher’s exact test, two-sided) (Supplementary Fig. S2 and Supplementary Table S3). TERT mutations in CNS tumours. In CNS tumours, TERT promoter mutations were found in 43% (51/118) of all cases with an equal prevalence of both mutations (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S4). The frequency of TERT mutations was different according to the tumour histology and grade (Fig. 1c): although pilocytic astrocytomas (World Health Organization (WHO) grade 1) and diffuse astrocytoma (WHO grade 2) showed a lower frequency of mutations (8% and 15%, respectively), the most aggressive form, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; WHO grade 4), present the highest frequency of TERT mutations (62%). Oligodendrogliomas (WHO grade 2) and anaplastic oligodendrogliomas (WHO grade 3) also harboured a high frequency of TERT mutations (45% and 54%, respectively). The presence of TERT mutations was significantly associated with a higher mean age at diagnosis (Supplementary Table S5) in CNS patients as a whole (Po0.0001; Mann–Whitney test, twotailed) and also in GBM patients only (P ¼ 0.0247; Mann– Whitney test, two-tailed); in oligodendroglioma patients, we found the same trend, although not statistically significant (P ¼ 0.0709; Mann–Whitney test, two-tailed). In addition, we observed that, in a subset of 14 GBM (8 TERT wild-type tumours and 6 TERT-mutated tumours), the tumours with TERT mutations showed a trend to increased immunohistochemistry (IHC) expression of telomerase, although this difference was not statistically significant (P ¼ 0.4250; Mann–Whitney test, two-tailed) (Fig. 2). TERT mutations in thyroid cancer. We analysed a large series of follicular cell-derived thyroid samples including normal thyroid (n ¼ 27), benign (n ¼ 81) and malignant lesions (n ¼ 263) (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S6). TERT mutations were only detected in malignant tumours (10%) (Fig. 1d), namely in Table 1 | Prevalence of TERT promoter recurrent mutations in human cancers.

Within the group of PTC, TERT mutations were detected to be associated to the so-called conventional PTC (cPTC) (11%).The majority of TERT-mutated thyroid cancers harboured the  124 G4A mutation (22 out of 27 cases) (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Table S7). In thyroid cancer patients, TERT mutations were significantly associated with guarded prognosis features such as larger tumours (P ¼ 0.008; Mann–Whitney test, two-tailed), older patients (Po0.0001; Mann–Whitney test, two-tailed) and male gender (P ¼ 0.0312; Fisher’s exact test, two-sided) (Supplementary Table S5). After histotype stratification, such correlations were only kept in the group of cPTC where we also found significant associations with lymph node metastasis (P ¼ 0.0318; Fisher’s exact test, two-sided) and BRAFV600E mutation (P ¼ 0.001; Fisher’s exact test, two-sided) (Supplementary Fig. S2 and Supplementary Table S8).

In bladder cancer, TERT mutations were frequently detected (48/82; 59%) both in lowgrade tumours (14/21; 67%) and high-grade tumours (34/61; 56%) (Table 1 and Fig. 1e; Supplementary Table S9). The  124 G4A mutation was present in 30 cases, whereas the  146 G4A was found in 18 cases. No association was found between the presence of the mutation and the age of the patients. No mutations were detected in 26 kidney cancers, 17 phaeochromocytoma and 36 GISTs (Supplementary Tables S10, S11 and S12, respectively). Discussion Recent findings have described that TERT promoter mutations arise as a novel mechanism of telomerase reactivation/expression in human cancers1,2. In this work, we report for the first time the presence of these mutations in different histotypes of thyroid cancer, and our results validate the findings reported by others in melanoma, bladder and gliomas1–3. Furthermore, we present for the first time evidence showing that TERT promoter mutations are significantly associated with increased TERT mRNA expression in thyroid cancers. We also found a trend for increased telomerase expression in cases of GBM harbouring TERT promoter mutations. In thyroid cancers, TERT mRNA was particularly high in cases harbouring both TERT and BRAF mutations. The location of these mutations in the TERT promoter, rather than the coding region of the gene, creating additional binding sites for transcription factors, represents also a novel mechanism of genetic activation in cancer. The frequency of TERT mutations we detected in skin melanomas is similar to that reported by Horn et al.1 in primary melanomas (33%), but lower than the frequency found by the same authors in metastatic melanomas (85%) and by Huang et al.2 in a series of 70 melanomas and short-term cultures1,2. In our series, we have analysed few metastatic melanomas that did not show a significantly higher percentage of TERT mutations. As our series is too small to allow a conclusion, it remains to be verified if there is an increased frequency of TERT mutations in metastatic melanomas, as suggested by previous reports1,2. We have confirmed, in skin melanomas, the significant association between TERT and BRAF mutations, as previously advanced by Horn et al.1, which we now also demonstrate in thyroid cancers. Interestingly, in benign nevi, which frequently harbour BRAF mutations, we did not detect TERT mutations. This finding, together with the high frequency of TERT mutations in metastatic melanomas1, suggests that, although BRAF mutations are thought to be an early event in melanoma genesis, TERT mutations may occur at a later stage. No TERT promoter mutations were found in ocular melanomas, which, at variance with skin melanomas, harbour GNAQ mutations instead of BRAF mutations4,5. Our results further support the assumption that ocular melanomas result from different etiopathogenic mechanism than skin melanomas5,6. Our data on CNS tumours indicate that TERT promoter mutations are frequent events in gliomas, particularly in GBM where the highest mutation frequency was found. It has been shown that TERT mutations conferred enhanced TERT promoter activity in vitro1,2; our findings fit with this assumption because we observed that GBM with TERT promoter mutations appear to display increased telomerase expression, despite the limited sensitivity of IHC and the low number of cases analysed. Our results are also in concordance with those of Lotsch et al.7 who reported that 60% of GBMs were positive for TERT mRNA and telomerase activity7. It will be interesting to assess whether the GBM positive for telomerase activity described by Lotsch et al.7 also harbour TERT promoter mutations. Our findings also indicate that TERT mutations are associated with older patients, in accordance with a recent report3. The high frequency of TERT mutations in CNS tumours, particularly in intermediate and high-grade tumours, opens a window for new approaches in the therapy of CNS tumours. In thyroid cancer, TERT mutations were only found in follicular cell-derived cancers (PTC, follicular thyroid carcinoma, poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma). No mutations were detected in medullary thyroid carcinomas, as described by Killela et al.3, nor in normal thyroid and benign lesions, such as goitre, adenomas or thyroiditis; this finding fits with previous studies that reported telomerase expression in malignant lesions and not in normal tissue or hyperplastic lesions8,9.

All rights reserved. male gender), but, after histotype stratification, these associations were only maintained in cPTC. Studies in larger series will be necessary to clarify these associations. In cPTC, TERT mutations were associated with BRAF mutation, highlighting the coexistence of activation of BRAF and TERT, previously reported in melanoma1 (Supplementary Fig. S2). Our results reinforce the hypothesis of a link between BRAF activation and telomerase expression, which can be mediated by transcription factors binding to the newly created consensus binding sites, as previously advanced by Horn et al.1. Both in thyroid carcinoma and melanoma, it seems that a ‘background’ status of activated BRAF enhances the effects of TERT promoter mutation. Our results in TERT mRNA expression strengthen this assumption, showing, for the first time, an increased TERT expression in tumours harbouring BRAF and TERT mutation (Fig. 3). Further observational and mechanistic studies are needed to clarify these points. TERT alterations seem to constitute an early and frequent event in bladder cancer. These findings fit with the high prevalence of telomerase activity previously described in bladder tumours10. The recurrent hotspot mutations in TERT were advanced to be, in melanomas, induced by ultraviolet radiation2. Bladder is a target for several chemical carcinogens; it remains to be found whether TERT mutations can also result from the action of such agents. The identification of TERT mutations in urine may provide a biomarker for early diagnosis and monitoring of bladder cancer. No TERT mutations were detected in kidney cancers, nor in 17 phaeochromocytoma and 36 GISTs. The underlying reasons for the tissue specificity of TERT mutations remain to be clarified. We can hypothesize that TERT mutations can be present in two settings. As described by Killela et al.3, TERT mutations can be relevant in tissues with relative low rates of self-renewal, which fits with our findings in follicular cell-derived thyroid cancer and gliomas where they are associated with the older age of the patients. On the other hand, these mutations can also result from environmental factors such as ultraviolet radiation and chemical carcinogens as suggested by their high frequency in melanoma, bladder and tongue1–3. In summary, our data identify TERT mutations as common events in human cancers and support the assumption that TERT promoter mutations may be one of the mechanisms that underlies telomerase reactivation in several types of human tumours.  Transcriptional reactivation of TERT, the catalytic subunit of telomerase, is necessary for cancer progression in about 90% of human cancers. The recent discovery of two prevalent somatic mutations—C250T and C228T—in the TERT promoter in various cancers has provided insight into a plausible mechanism of TERT reactivation. Although the two hotspot mutations create a similar binding motif for E-twenty-six (ETS) transcription factors, we show that they are functionally distinct, in that the C250T unlike the C228T TERT promoter is driven by non-canonical NF-κB signalling. We demonstrate that binding of ETS to the mutant TERT promoter is insufficient in driving its transcription but this process requires non-canonical NF-κB signalling for stimulus responsiveness, sustained telomerase activity and hence cancer progression. Our findings highlight a previously unrecognized role of non-canonical NF-κB signalling in tumorigenesis and elucidate a fundamental mechanism for TERT reactivation in cancers, which if targeted could have immense therapeutic implications.  The telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene encodes the catalytic subunit of the telomerase complex, which is necessary for subverting the adverse effects of progressive telomere shortening1–4. Unlike in stem cells, telomerase activity is typically low or absent in most somatic cells owing to negligible levels of TERT arising from transcriptional repression of its promoter5. Hence, reactivation of the TERT gene through transcriptional de-repression of its promoter is the rate-limiting step in reconstituting telomerase activity, which is an essential prerequisite for the progression of most human cancers6–8. Distinct from its role in telomere elongation, various extra-telomeric functions of TERT critical for cancer development have also been described9–12. Clearly, understanding how the human TERT (hTERT—hereafter referred as TERT) promoter is reactivated in cancers is key to unravelling a fundamental mechanism of cancer progression. Recently, two mutually exclusive and highly recurrent mutations in the core TERT promoter—C250T or C228T (refs 13, 14)—were described, providing a plausible handle for studying the mechanism of TERT reactivation.  Several transcription factors including Myc, β-catenin and NF-κB have been proposed to be drivers of the TERT promoter, on the basis of evidence that binding sites for these factors exist on the TERT promoter15,16. NF-κB is a transcription factor well known for regulating many cellular pathways including tumorigenesis17,18. Although NF-κB signalling can regulate TERT expression in vitro9 and two potential NF-κB-binding motifs have been identified within the TERT promoter19, regulation of TERT by NF-κB in human cancers is not documented. As NF-κB-dependent activation of tumour-promoting pathways has been implicated in the pathogenesis of glioblastoma multiforme20 (GBM), the most aggressive form of brain malignancy with high telomerase activity21, we examined whether NF-κB mediates transcription of TERT in GBM. Surprisingly, we uncover a NF-κB-binding site in the TERT promoter that specifically maps to one of the two hotspot mutations (C250T or C228T; refs 13, 14) in the core TERT promoter and show that this binding is essential for activation of the mutant TERT promoter. Although enhanced transcriptional activity of the TERT promoter has been correlated with C250T or C228T mutations22–24, the definite mechanism(s) underscoring the induction of TERT transcription by these mutations remain poorly understood. It is not clear whether both mutations lead to activation of the promoter by similar mechanisms. Our data suggest that the two TERT promoter mutations that were predicted to generate the same ETS-binding site are functionally distinct, in that the C250T unlike the C228T TERT promoter is driven by non-canonical NF-κB signalling. Consistent with literature25,26 that suggests that ETS factors require dimerization with other transcription factors for transactivation, we find that binding of ETS alone to the C250T mutant TERT promoter is insufficient to activate transcription. Efficient reactivation of TERT at this mutant promoter requires cooperation with p52, downstream of non-canonical NF-κB signalling.  Go to: RESULTS Non-canonical NF-κB signalling selectively induces TERT expression in C250T-mutant cells  The NF-κB signalling pathway is functionally segregated into canonical and non-canonical arms27. Results from GBM cells stimulated with TNF-α and TWEAK (tumour necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis), which activate the canonical and non-canonical NF-κB arms respectively, showed that although TNF-α caused a strong induction of NF-κB target genes—IL-8 and I κ Bα in all GBM cell lines—it did not cause changes in TERT expression (Supplementary Fig. 1a). In contrast, a subset of GBM cell lines exhibited TERT induction following TWEAK exposure (Fig. 1a). Sequencing the TERT promoter region of these cell lines unexpectedly led to a distinct segregation of these lines that induce TERT after TWEAK stimulation, based on their TERT promoter mutation status (Fig. 1b). Upregulation of TERT in GBM cells containing the C250T mutation correlated with a strong induction of telomerase activity in C250T-mutant cells (Fig. 1c). It is noteworthy that small changes in TERT transcription are sufficient for a significant increase in telomerase activity28,29.  Figure 1 Figure 1 TWEAK-induced non-canonical NF-κB signalling regulates TERT expression and telomerase function in C250T GBM cells. (a) GBM cell lines were treated with TWEAK for one or two days and analysed for TERT expression by qPCR. Plots depict relative fold ... The soluble form of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily member, tumour necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK), at low physiological concentration (10–30 ng ml−1) predominantly activates non-canonical NF-κB signalling through the Fn14 receptor30,31. Activation of the non-canonical NF-κB pathway induces NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) to stimulate the processing of NF-κB2 p100 to p52 (ref. 32), which forms a heterodimer with RelB, leading to transcriptional activation of selective NF-κB target genes33,34. GBM cells carrying the C228T mutation did not show induction of TERT or significant differences in telomerase activity following TWEAK stimulation (Fig. 1a,c), although these cell lines express similar levels of Fn14 and levels of TWEAK-induced nuclear p52 and RelB accumulation seen were comparable to C250T cells (Supplementary Fig. 1b,c). These results suggest that although similar levels of p52/RelB are activated in all GBM cells, only the C250T-mutant TERT promoter is responsive to these dimers. Consistent with the induction of TERT transcription and telomerase activity, C250T-mutant GBM cells exhibited a significant increase in p52 occupancy on the TERT promoter whereas no p52 enrichment was seen in C228T GBM cells (Fig. 1d). Specific enrichment of p52 at the C250T TERT promoter following TWEAK stimulation also led to increased RNA polymerase II (Pol II) recruitment (Fig. 1d). In contrast to the TERT promoter, TWEAK-induced p52 and Pol II enrichment at a known p52 target gene promoter, namely BLC (B lymphocyte chemoattractant or CXCL13), occurred with similar efficiency in both C250T and C228T GBM lines (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Lentiviral knockdown of p52, RelB and NIK abolished the induction of TERT in TWEAK-stimulated C250T GBM cells, verifying that TWEAK-mediated effects on the C250T TERT promoter are specifically mediated through non-canonical NF-κB signalling (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 2b). Association of p65 (RelA) at the TERT promoter was not observed in TWEAK-induced C250T GBM cells (Fig. 1d). Furthermore, TNF-α stimulation failed to recruit p52 to the TERT promoter (Supplementary Fig. 2c) although efficient p65 and Pol II recruitment to the canonical target gene promoter, NF-κ B1A, was observed (Supplementary Fig. 2d).  These observations were also recapitulated when T98G and U251 cells, containing the C250T and C228T TERT mutations respectively, were stimulated with agonistic human LTβR antibody, another ligand that activates non-canonical NF-κB signalling34,35. Although anti-LTβR stimulated a similar pattern of p100 processing to p52 in both cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 3a), significant induction of TERT messenger RNA was seen in T98G but not in U251 cells (Supplementary Fig. 3b). These findings corresponded with a significant enrichment of p52 and Pol II at the TERT promoter in T98G cells but not in U251 cells (Supplementary Fig. 3c), although similar levels of p52 and Pol II recruitment at the BLC promoter were detected in all cells with anti-LTβR (Supplementary Fig. 3d). Increased occupancy of p52 on the C250T TERT promoter correlated with their enhanced proliferation (Supplementary Fig. 3e) as well as increased telomerase activity after anti-LTβR treatment (Supplementary Fig. 3f). In contrast, anti-LTβR-treated U251 cells exhibited no difference in proliferation and telomerase activity (Supplementary Fig. 3e,f). Taken together, these findings suggest that non-canonical NF-κB signalling specifically activates the C250T TERT promoter in human GBM cells.  C250T TERT promoter mutation creates a p52-binding site  NF-κB dimers bind the consensus sequence 5′-GGGRN(Y)YYCC-3′. However, the nucleotide sequence spanning the C250T mutation site does not form a complete NF-κB consensus motif. Although NF-κB dimers have been observed to bind only one half-site (5′-GGGGG-3′ or 5′-GGAA-3′) in vitro36, in vivo half-site binding of NF-κB dimers, especially p52/RelB, has not been investigated. We thus examined whether p52 can bind half-site at the C250T TERT promoter using the only available in vivo p52 ChIP-seq data from lymphoblastoid B cells37. Through de novo motif analysis38–40, we identified the palindromic p52 motif from 12,239 p52 ChIP-seq peaks (Fig. 2a) and analysed these binding regions for p52 half-site binding in vivo. The total binding energy (G-score) of the 11-base-pair p52 motif was decomposed into left and right half-site GL and GR (Fig. 2b) and p52 motif enrichment was computed in two-dimensional GL–G space (Fig. 2b)38,41 From this plot, 11 base pairs with high binding affinity (low G-score) were recognized as full-site binding regions and were uniformly distributed along anti-diagonal lines (Fig. 2b—area in triangle)41. In contrast, 11 base pairs with lower full-site binding affinity regions tend to enrich in the half-site binding regions (Fig. 2b—area in rectangles) where only one of the half-site GL or GR is low41. We therefore provide evidence that p52 binds to half-sites in vivo.  Figure 2 Figure 2 C250T TERT promoter mutation creates a p52-binding site. (a) Sequence logo of the p52 motif de novo discovered by TherMos (ref. 38) from the p52 ChIP-seq library37. The 11-base-pair motif is palindromic with the left and right half-sites separated by ... The electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) demonstrated enhanced binding on the DNA probe containing the C250T TERT promoter sequence relative to the wild-type (WT) TERT promoter (Fig. 2c, lanes 1–2) using nuclear extracts from the C250T line T98G. Whereas activation of NF-κB DNA binding to its established consensus motif was dependent on TNF-α stimulation (Fig. 2d, lanes 3–4), DNA binding to the C250T TERT promoter was unperturbed by TNF-α stimulation (Fig. 2d, lanes 7–8). This is consistent with earlier observations that regulation of the C250T TERT promoter is independent of canonical NF-κB signalling. Supershift EMSA with antibodies targeting NF-κB2 (p100/p52) and RelB diminished protein binding to the C250T TERT promoter (Fig. 2e, lanes 3–5). In contrast, antibodies targeting c-Rel and unspecific IgG did not affect protein binding on the C250T TERT promoter (Fig. 2e, lanes 6–7). To verify the functional implications of p52/RelB binding on the C250T TERT promoter, we performed short interfering RNA (siRNA) experiments on T98G and U251 cells. Significant downregulation of TERT was observed in T98G cells but not in U251 cells following downregulation of NF-κB2 and RelB (Supplementary Fig. 3g). Enhanced binding to the C250T TERT promoter was observed with TWEAK stimulation (Fig. 2f, lanes 1–2) and this binding was disrupted by antibodies against NF-κB2 (p100/p52) and RelB but not c-Rel and IgG (Fig. 2f, lanes 3–6). RelB does not possess DNA-binding activity as a homodimer but rather mediates its transactivation function by forming a heterodimer with p52 (refs 42,43). Recombinant p52 robustly bound to the C250T TERT promoter in a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. 4a, lanes 4–6) whereas GST protein did not (Supplementary Fig. 4a, lane 7). A DNA probe containing the known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) κB binding sites for p52 (ref. 43) was used a control for p52 binding (Supplementary Fig. 4a, lanes 2–3). Binding of p52 to the C250T TERT promoter was completely abolished when two residues in the rel homology region (RHR) critical for DNA binding were mutated (Supplementary Fig. 4b, lane 6). Taken together, these results provide evidence for a p52 binding site on the C250T TERT promoter and demonstrate a previously unrecognized function of non-canonical NF-κB signalling in regulation of TERT transcription.  Non-canonical NF-κB activation enhances tumorigenicity of C250T-mutant GBMs by increasing telomerase activity  NIK is a MAP3K kinase that signals downstream of TWEAK/Fn14 and LtβR to induce phosphorylation of p100 by IκB kinase α (IKKα), leading to p100 ubiquitylation and processing to p52 (refs 33,34). Thus, NIK overexpression activates the non-canonical NF-κB pathway, resulting in the generation of mature p52 (ref. 44). Ectopically expressed NIK upregulated TERT expression in T98G cells whereas expression of kinase-inactive mutant NIK (NIK KK) did not (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 5a), indicating that NIK-induced processing of p100 was necessary for activation of the C250T TERT promoter. This was consistent with the significant enrichment of p52 and Pol II at the TERT promoter (Supplementary Fig. 5b) and the induction of telomerase activity in NIK-expressing T98G cells (Supplementary Fig. 5c). In contrast, NIK expression in U251 cells did not affect TERT expression (Fig. 3a), telomerase activity (Supplementary Fig. 5c) or recruitment of p52 or Pol II at the TERT promoter (Supplementary Fig. 5b), although both complexes were significantly enriched at the BLC promoter (Supplementary Fig. 5d). These findings were consistent with reporter assays using these TERT promoters. Ectopic expression of NIK augmented the transcriptional activity at the C250T TERT promoter-driven but not WT TERT promoter-driven luciferase and this effect was not seen when NIK KK was expressed (Supplementary Fig. 5e). Furthermore, TWEAK treatment resulted in increased transcriptional activity at the C250T TERT promoter but not the WT TERT promoter (Supplementary Fig. 5f).  Figure 3 Figure 3 Ectopic expression of NIK promotes telomerase function and proliferation of C250T GBM cells. (a) Relative TERT expression was analysed in T98G and U251 cells transfected with vector, human NIK WT or kinase-inactive mutant NIK (KK) vector constructs. Data ... Ectopic expression of NIK in T98G cells caused increased cell proliferation (Fig. 3b,c), which was abolished following treatment with siRNA against TERT (Fig. 3d,e), suggesting that the NIK-mediated growth advantage depends on upregulation of TERT and hence telomerase activity. Induction of TERT mRNA and cell proliferation in NIK-expressing C250T cells were abrogated following treatment with siRNA against NF-κB2 and RelB but not RelA, further suggesting that NIK-regulated activation of the C250T TERT promoter is mediated through the non-canonical NF-κB pathway (Fig. 3f,g and Supplementary Fig. 5g,h). Ectopic expression of NIK (Supplementary Fig. 6a) markedly enhanced in vivo tumour growth of T98G cells (Fig. 4a,b and Supplementary Fig. 6b,c), which were previously reported to be non-tumorigenic in immunodeficient mice45. In contrast, T98G cells expressing vector control or NIK in combination with short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting p52 (Supplementary Fig. 6a) were not tumorigenic in vivo (Fig. 4a,b and Supplementary Fig. 6b). Enhanced tumorigenic potential of NIK-expressing T98G cells in NOD-SCID mice was consistent with their increased telomerase activity relative to vector control that was abolished in NIK p52 shRNA cells (Supplementary Fig. 6d). Gliomagenesis and invasiveness of these human cells in orthotopic glioma xenograft models showed accelerated tumour growth in mice that were xenotransplanted with NIK-expressing T98G cells (Fig. 4c). One of three mice implanted with vector T98G cells developed an intracranial tumour, but all three mice bearing NIK-expressing T98G cells developed gliomas and this increased tumorigenesis was completely abolished by p52 knockdown (Fig. 4c). These observations therefore support the critical role of the non-canonical NF-κB pathway in activating TERT expression and telomerase function through the C250T TERT promoter, hence potentiating in vivo tumorigenicity. We also analysed NIK and TERT expression levels in primary human tumours derived from GBM patients using immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, and simultaneously sequenced genomic DNA extracted from the same tumour material for TERT promoter mutations. From the 29 GBM tumours analysed, 28% and 38% of the samples harboured C250T (n=8) and C228T (n=11) TERT mutations respectively, 34% of tumours were WT for the TERT promoter (n=10) (Fig. 4d). Tumours containing TERT promoter mutations exhibited increased TERT expression compared with WT tumours (Fig. 4d). In particular, C250T-positive tumours had significantly higher TERT expression compared with WT tumours (P=0.0017; t-test, two-tailed; Fig. 4d). Tumours with the C228T mutation showed a trend of higher TERT levels as compared with WT tumours, although the difference was not statistically significant (P =0.0859; t-test, two-tailed; Fig. 4d). Further IHC analysis of these tumours for NIK expression revealed a positive correlation (P =0.028; Linear regression test) between increased NIK expression and high TERT levels particularly in C250T tumours (Fig. 4e,f). This association between elevated NIK levels and TERT overexpression in GBM tumours was not seen in WT tumours or in C228T tumours (Fig. 4e,f). These findings highlight the significant concordance between enhanced NIK expression and increased telomerase expression in GBM tumours carrying the C250T mutation.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Constitutive non-canonical NF-κB activation promotes in vivo tumorigenicity of C250T GBM cells. (a) T98G cells expressing vector, NIK WT or NIK p52 shRNA were injected subcutaneously into 5 NOD-SCID mice per group. Picture shows tumours isolated ... Targeted reversal of C250T mutation abolishes activation of TERT by p52  To confirm whether p52 binds the C250T loci and no other location on this promoter, we targeted this mutation site using CRISPR/Cas9 technology to reverse this point mutation to the WT in the genome of T98G cells. Two guide RNAs targeting the TERT promoter were each selected to mediate a single Cas9 endonuclease-induced double-stranded break at either loci adjacent to C250T mutation site (Fig. 5a) and single-stranded oligonucleotides containing the WT TERT promoter sequence were co-transfected into T98G cells to mediate genome editing. We obtained three T98G clones that carried the WT TERT promoter sequence—two het clones with one copy of the thymine residue repaired to cytosine and one clone with both alleles edited (Fig. 5b). Reversal of the C250T mutation to WT resulted in an appreciable reduction of telomerase activity (Fig. 5c) and proliferation (Fig. 5d,e) of all three WT clones, relative to a C250T-positive clone that was similarly isolated following the CRISPR/Cas9 screen. Furthermore, C250T reversal abolished TWEAK-mediated induction of TERT expression (Fig. 5f) and telomerase function (Fig. 5g) in all three WT clones but not the C250T-positive clone, which retained similar telomerase activity as control T98G cells (Fig. 5c). Consistently, TWEAK-induced recruitment of p52 and Pol II to the TERT promoter was abrogated following C250T reversal (Fig. 5h) although similar enrichment of the two factors was found at the BLC promoter, on TWEAK stimulation, in both the C250T-positive and WT clones (Fig. 5i). These findings therefore reaffirm that this single hotspot mutation generates a binding site for p52 that drives TERT reactivation in GBMs.  Figure 5 Figure 5 CRISPR/Cas9-mediated reversal of the C250T mutation abolishes p52 activation of the TERT promoter. (a) gRNAs targeting the TERT promoter at various loci adjacent to the C250T mutation site were cloned into pSpCas9 (BB) vector and co-transfected with a ... p52 interacts with ETS factors at the C250T TERT promoter to mediate TERT reactivation  The C>T transition is predicted to create a binding motif for the E-twenty-six (ETS) family of transcription factors (GGAA, opposite strand)13,14. As NF-κB factors have been previously demonstrated to interact with ETS proteins46,47, we performed immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag beads in T98G cells expressing Flag-tagged p52. p52 co-immunoprecipitated ETS1 and ETS2 in T98G cells (Fig. 6a), confirming the physical interaction between p52 and ETS factors. Consistent with this, ChIP re-ChIP showed ETS1/2 association with p52 at the TERT promoter in T98G cells (Fig. 6b). Furthermore, knockdown of ETS1/ETS2 or NIK similarly reduced proliferation in C250T-mutant GBM cells (Fig. 6c–f). ETS1/ETS2 are known to be auto-inhibited and require cooperative binding with another transcription factor by forming a homodimer25,26 or a heterodimer48 for DNA-binding activities. Our experimental results show that ETS1/2 and p52 co-bind the C250T region but not the C228T region. As both C250T and C228T TERT mutations generate the same ETS consensus motif de novo, we examined the TERT promoter region spanning both mutation sites for cooperative binding between ETS and p52/RelB to explain the differential response observed. Using TACO to predict co-association of ETS–p52/RelB heterodimers at the chromatin49, we found all three dimers to be highly enriched in two cell lines (adjusted P value of less than 0.05; Fig. 7a) The consensus of the three dimers 5′-nTCCnn(T/A)TCC-3′ indicates that p52 and ETS1 may form a heterodimer with a 2-base-pair (bp) space. As the p52 half-site motif is very similar to the ETS1 consensus site, it is not feasible to pinpoint which half-site is bound by p52. However, it is worth noting that both 5′-T1C2C3-3′ half-sites require a T at position 1 instead of a C. No enrichment of another p52/RelB half-site motif 5′-NCCCC-3′ in the dimers also highlights the importance of T in both half-sites. We therefore aligned the consensus of the enriched dimer to the C250T and C228T regions and found that the C250T region perfectly matches the two ‘TCC’ half-sites with the correct spacing. In contrast, the C228T region lacks a T on the right half-site, which may explain the less favourable binding of the p52/ETS1 heterodimer to the C228T region (Fig. 7a).  Figure 6 Figure 6 ETS factors regulate proliferation of GBM cells and interact with p52 at the C250T TERT promoter. (a) p52 interacts with both ETS1 and ETS2. Lysates of Flag–p52-overexpressing T98G cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag beads and analysed ... Figure 7 Figure 7 p52 cooperates with ETS factors at the C250T TERT promoter. (a) Cooperative binding between p52/RelB and ETS1 predicted by TACO (ref. 49). Top panel: motifs used in TACO. Middle panel: dimer motifs enriched in various cell lines with significant P values. ... To verify cooperative binding between p52 and ETS factors in vitro, we performed EMSA using recombinant p52 and ETS1 proteins. Whereas p52 bound both the WT and C250T TERT promoters (Fig. 7b, lanes 1 and 4), we found that ETS1 bound specifically to the mutant TERT promoter (Fig. 7b, lanes 2 and 5), which supports current evidence that TERT promoter mutations generate ETS binding sites de novo13,14,50. Our ChIP analysis further confirmed that ETS1 can bind the C250T TERT promoter without stimulation (Fig. 7c). Notably, addition of p52 and ETS1 proteins to the mutant TERT promoter resulted in enhanced binding of p52/ETS and a complex of higher mobility (Fig. 7b, lane 6), thus validating our bioinformatics prediction. siRNA against ETS1/ETS2 reduced the induction of TERT expression in TWEAK-treated T98G cells (Fig. 7d), and decreased p52 and Pol II enrichment at the TERT promoter (Fig. 7e), suggesting that ETS1/2 occupancy at the C250T TERT promoter is critical for p52-mediated activation of TERT transcription. Notably, p52 enrichment at the TERT promoter was completely abolished in T98G cells treated with ETS1 siRNA (Fig. 7e), which is probably attributed to the predominant expression of ETS1 and its association with p52 in T98G cells (Fig. 6a; red asterisk). Correspondingly, the increase in telomerase activity was abrogated in all three TWEAK-induced C250T GBM cell lines that were pre-treated with siRNAs targeting ETS1 or ETS2 (Fig. 7f).  Go to: DISCUSSION We uncover a NF-κB-binding site in the C250T mutant TERT promoter that is essential for its activation. We show that the C250T TERT promoter, unlike C228T, is driven by non-canonical NF-κB signalling. Binding of ETS factors to the C250T-mutant TERT promoter in the absence of non-canonical NF-κB signalling is insufficient to activate TERT transcription and efficient reactivation requires cooperation with the p52 subunit of NF-κB, downstream of non-canonical NF-κB signalling. We also show that ETS–p52 cooperation occurs only in context of the mutant C250T sequence (Fig. 7a,b) and these data explain why TERT is not activated by NF-κB signalling in somatic cells with the WT TERT promoter sequence. On the basis of the results presented, we propose a model for telomerase reactivation in human cancers harbouring C250T TERT promoter mutations (Fig. 7g). TERT expression is low when ETS1/2 alone is bound at the C250T promoter. On activation of non-canonical NF-κB signalling through exogenous ligands (for example, TWEAK) or constitutive NIK expression, p52 is recruited to the C250T promoter and cooperates with ETS factors to drive efficient TERT transcription (Fig. 7g). Enhanced TERT expression promotes telomerase activity, necessary for cancer progression (Fig. 4a–c). Strong support for this model is provided by the evidence that the C250T mutation site when reversed to WT status by CRISPR/Cas9 loses ETS1/2 binding and p52 is no longer recruited or stabilized at the TERT promoter (Fig. 5h,i), resulting in the loss of TERT expression (Fig. 5f), telomerase activity (Fig. 5g) and cancer cell growth (Fig. 5d,e). Although recombinant p52 binds in vitro to the WT TERT promoter (Fig. 7b), this half-site binding at non-physiological concentrations is not reflective of in vivo interactions as demonstrated by ChIP (Fig. 5h). The non-canonical NF-κB pathway is predominantly known to regulate lymphoid organ development51, B cell activity and differentiation52, dendritic cell function53,54, and bone metabolism34,52. There has been accumulating evidence documenting the involvement of NIK in tumorigenesis of melanoma55, breast cancer56 and multiple myeloma35,57. The canonical NF-κB pathway has been shown to be associated with progression of many cancers and thought to be required for acquisition of resistance to chemotherapy58–61. Unlike the canonical NF-κB activity that is transient62 but strong, the non-canonical NF-κB signalling is known to be slow but persistent. We reason that given that the TERT promoter needs to be open persistently following reactivation, tumour cells co-opt to use the non-canonical NF-κB activity (much like it is used in organogenesis) for continued expression of TERT in the proliferating tumour mass. Indeed recent studies have documented increased levels of RelB and NIK in human GBMs (refs 63,64), implicating the role of non-canonical NF-κB signalling in GBM survival and tumour progression. We conclude that the non-canonical NF-κB pathway is essential for telomerase reactivation in human cancers harbouring the highly prevalent C250T TERT promoter mutations.  Introduction The telomere sequences at the chromosomal ends, composed of tandem repeats of TTAGGG, are protected by a number of molecules that constitute the capping Shelterin complex [1 ;  2]. The incomplete replication due to limitations of the process, called ‘end-replication problem’, results in shortening of telomeres in each successive mitotic cell division that eventually leads to replicative senescence referred to as the ‘Hayflick limit’ [3; 4 ;  5]. Maintenance of telomere repeat length is dependent on sustained expression of telomerase holoenzyme that adds de novo repeat units at the end of each replication cycle [ 6 ;  7]. Progressive attrition of telomeres is also defined as one of the hallmarks of aging of organisms [ 8 ;  9]. Cancer cells, characteristically, acquire infinite capability to divide through maintenance of telomeres by sustained expression of telomerase or in its absence by an alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) mechanism [ 10; 11; 12; 13; 14 ;  15••].  Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase that together with a RNA component, TERC, maintains genomic integrity by telomere elongation [ 16]. Though TERT and TERC are sufficient for in vitro telomerase activity, the in vivo telomerase functioning requires additional components that associate with TERT and TERC, to form the holoenzyme [ 17 ;  18]. Those include dyskerin (DKC), NOP10 ribonucleoprotein (NOP10), GAR1 ribonucleoprotein homolog (yeast) (GAR1), NHP2 ribonucleoprotein (NHP2), reptin and pontin [ 11; 19; 20; 21 ;  22].  Deregulation of telomerase has been shown to be a ubiquitous feature in human cancers with over 90% of cancers showing an upregulation of the enzyme [11; 23 ;  24]. The telomerase activity is dependent on a number of factors, regulated at various stages, which include gene transcription, mRNA splicing, maturation and modifications of TERT and TERC, transport and localization of those components and assembly of active telomerase ribonucleoprotein to telomeres [ 4; 5; 16; 20; 21; 25; 26 ;  27]. The catalytic component TERT acts as a determinant of telomerase activity and its transcription is repressed in most of the somatic cells with the exception of proliferative cells of self-renewing tissues [ 28; 29 ;  30]. An increased expression of TERT has been consistently demonstrated to be a fundamental requirement for cellular transformation [ 4; 31; 32; 33; 34• ;  35].  The mechanism of TERT upregulation in cancers had been attributed to several mechanisms including epigenetic deregulation as well as genetic amplification of the locus containing TERT gene [ 36 ;  37]. In the absence of any evidence of a definite mechanism, the telomerase activity in tumor cells has been attributed to the assumption of stem cells being the progenitors in all cancers [38]. The normal stem cells in self-renewing tissues retain telomerase throughout lifetime replication thus abrogating a requirement for a positive selection [6]. The recently discovered TERT promoter mutations add a new dimension to the acquisition of telomerase activity in human cancers. In this review we provide an overview and possible implications of the newly discovered mutations in the promoter of the TERT gene in a wide range of cancers.  Structure and regulation of the TERT promoter The human TERT gene is located on chromosome 5p15.33 and the promoter region of the gene is considered to be the most important regulatory element for telomerase expression. The TERT promoter contains binding motifs for several factors that regulate the gene transcription and distinctly lacks a TATA box or a similar sequence [ 39; 40; 41; 42 ;  43]. The core promoter region consists of 260 base pairs with several transcription-factor binding sites that include E-boxes where c-Myc has been confirmed to bind and activate the transcription [ 44; 45; 46; 47 ;  48]. BRCA1 in conjunction with N-Myc interacting protein (Nmi) forms a complex with c-Myc and inhibits TERT promoter activity, that property is lost in some mutant forms of BRCA1 [ 49]. Other sequence elements in TERT promoter include GC-boxes, which are binding sites for zinc finger transcription factor, Sp1 [ 4 ;  45]. Transcription of the TERT gene is also regulated by various hormones, cytokines and oncogenes [ 45]. Several repressors of the TERT transcription are also known. p53 has been shown to downregulate TERT transcription in a Sp1-dependent manner [ 50]. Ets transcription factors that comprise over 30 members are prominently associated with telomerase activation [ 42 ;  51]. Ets2 has been shown to form a complex with c-Myc in a breast cancer cell line [ 44 ;  51]. Ets transcription factors are also shown to be stimulated by oncogenes EGF, Her2/Nez, Ras and Raf [ 52 ;  53]. The activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressors are known to account for cellular immortalization through induction of TERT transcription [ 54]. The high GC content around the transcription start site of the TERT promoter confers epigenetic regulation through methylation and chromatin remodeling [ 37 ;  55].  TERT promoter mutations in human cancers A discovery of a high-penetrant disease-segregating causal germline mutation in a melanoma family and highly specific and recurrent somatic mutations in tumors from unrelated patients in the TERT promoter has likely provided a definite mechanism for cancer-specific TERT activation [ 56•• ;  57••]. Two independent studies using diverse approaches discovered non-coding mutations, mainly at two residues, within the core promoter region of the TERT gene. One study was based on the identification of a causal gene mutation in a large melanoma pedigree where affected individuals presented a severe form of the disease with an early age of onset. The linkage analysis identified a 2.2 megabase telomeric region on chromosome 5p that included TERT along with more than 80 other genes [ 56••]. Sequencing of the entire stretch of DNA region in the family resulted in identification of a disease segregating A > C (T > G) single base change at −57 bp (Chr 5: 1,295,161 hg19 coordinate) from ATG start site. The germline mutation was present in affected and absent in unaffected individuals in the family with the exception of one. Subsequent screening of cell lines derived from melanoma metastases from unrelated patients led to the detection of recurrent and mutually exclusive somatic mutations at two residues −124 and −146 from the ATG start site in the TERT promoter [ 56••]. Serendipitously, an independent study using a whole genome sequencing approach also reported the recurrent somatic TERT promoter mutations at the same positions [ 57••]. Other mutations detected in TERT promoter included the CC > TT tandem mutations at −124/−125 and −138/−139 bp from ATG start site. The germline and somatic mutations in the non-coding part of the TERT gene were defined by common salient features. One of the underlying features included a de novo creation of CCGGAA/T general binding motifs for E-twenty six/ternary complex factors (Ets/TCF) transcription factors, which differed from pre-existing GGAA/T Ets binding sites within the TERT promoter ( Figure 1). The somatic mutations at both positions being C > T and the additional detection of CC > TT tandem mutations in a proportion of tumors augmented the evidence for the UV-origin of tumor specific nucleotide changes in melanoma as shown previously in studies based on whole genome sequencing [58•]. Interestingly, the mutations detected in the TERT promoter in melanoma were more frequent than those in the BRAF gene.

The mutations create CCGGAA/T binding motif for Ets/TCF transcription factors that results in an increased TERT expression. Pre-existing binding sites for other transcriptions factors are shown above the sequence. Figure options It was also observed that the TERT promoter mutations tend to occur more often than expected by chance in tumors with either BRAF mutations (odds ratio [OR] 3.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3–8.2) or with concomitant alterations in both BRAF and CDKN2A (OR 5.6, 95% CI 2.4–13.8) [ 56••]. BRAF mutations, due to occurrence and role in development of melanocytic nevi, are considered as the driver genetic lesions in melanoma [ 56••; 59• ;  60]. The loss of CDKN2A has been suggested to play a role in the escape of melanocytes from BRAF induced senescence [61]. The acquisition of TERT promoter mutations can be hypothesized to facilitate stabilization of the transformed genome through reversal of telomeric loss. Most melanocytic nevi carry BRAF mutations, whereas TERT promoter mutations and CDKN2A alterations are detected only in primary melanoma and beyond [ 56•• ;  62].  Bonafide of newly discovered non-coding mutations in the TERT promoter was established by the detection in cancers other than melanoma [ 63••]. The frequency of the mutations seems to vary between cancer types (Table 1). The highest frequencies of the TERT promoter mutations have so far been reported, besides melanoma, in pleomorphic dermal sarcoma, myxoid liposarcoma, glioma, urothelial cell carcinoma of bladder, basal and squamous cell carcinoma of skin, liver cancer and others [ 63••; 64; 65; 66; 67; 68; 69; 70; 71; 72; 73; 74; 75 ;  76]. The mutations occur in other cancer types as well, albeit, at low frequencies [ 63•• ;  67]. Based on the prevalence in different cancer types it has been hypothesized that the TERT promoter mutations mainly occur in tumors that are derived from tissues with low rates of self-renewal [ 63•• ;  77]. Unlike melanoma and other skin related malignancies, no tumor from the cancers affecting internal organs carried CC > TT tandem mutations in the TERT promoter with the exception of that at the positions −138/−139 bp from ATG start site in bladder cancer. The tandem mutation reported so far in 4 of the 1231 bladder tumors could also be generated by a single-base mutation at −138 bp as the base change at −139 bp has been reported as a rare polymorphism represented by rs35550267 [ 56••; 65 ;  66]. The differences in mutational pattern in cancer types are known to reflect etiological divergences and the C > T base change in tumors can also be attributed to APOBEC cytidine deaminase expression in cancer development [ 78•• ;  79••].

Table options Functional aspects of TERT promoter mutations The high recurrence, specificity and gain of function support that the non-coding TERT promoter mutations are driver rather than passenger events in cancer development. The functional relevance of the mutations was indicated by the basic reporter assays that showed 2–4-fold increased promoter activity [ 56••; 57•• ;  80••]. Tumors from thyroid cancers, primary glioma, malignant pleural mesothelioma and liver cancers with TERT promoter mutations were associated with higher gene expression than those without mutations [ 67; 69; 72 ;  74]. Though limited at the moment, the available data do indicate a tendency of the TERT promoter mutations being present in specific clinical and phenotypic subtypes and appear to be associated with adversarial forms of the disease. While in medulloblastomas the TERT promoter mutations were inversely associated with increased OTX2 expression; in primary adult glioma, the mutations occurred mainly in conjunction with EGFR amplification [ 69]. Glioma patients with TERT promoter mutations showed an association with poorer survival than patients without mutations; in thyroid cancer, mutations are reportedly more frequent in advanced thyroid cancers than in papillary thyroid cancers [ 63••; 70 ;  71].  The studies on bladder cancer consistently showed that TERT promoter mutations are the most frequent lesions with even distribution across all stages and grades [ 65; 66 ;  80••]. Intriguingly, an observed interaction has raised a possibility of eventual use of the TERT promoter mutations in conjunction with a common polymorphism within the sequence as biomarkers in bladder cancer. The data from bladder cancer showed that the variant allele of a common polymorphism at −245 bp from ATG start site in the TERT promoter acts as a modifier of the effect of TERT promoter mutations on patient survival and disease recurrence [ 80••]. Bladder cancer patients with TERT promoter mutations in tumors showed almost two-fold decreased survival and increased disease recurrence in the absence but not in the presence of the variant allele for the rs2853669 polymorphism [ 80••]. Mechanistic support for the observation was provided by the fact that mutations result in de novo creation of Ets/TCF binding motifs; the variant allele of the rs2853669 polymorphism, on the contrary, disrupts a preexisting non-canonical Ets2 binding site in the proximal region of the TERT promoter, adjacent to an E-box [ 44].  The occurrence of highly specific TERT promoter mutations indicates a strong selection pressure for the gene over-expression on path to cellular transformation. Increased telomerase production has been demonstrated to promote cancer progression in an animal model [ 81•]. The effect of the promoter mutations on TERT expression can be tenable only in the presence of Ets/TCF transcription factors that can specifically bind to the de novo sites created by the mutations. Some of the Ets/TCF transcription factors are downstream targets of MAPK pathway, where BRAF is a prominent intermediate [ 82; 83 ;  84]. Whether in melanoma activated BRAF is a driving force in selection of TERT promoter mutations remains to be determined. Nevertheless, expression of Ets transcription factors is ubiquitous in melanoma and other cancers [ 85 ;  86].  Many studies have stressed the function of the TERT gene beyond its role in maintenance of the telomere; therefore the mutations in the TERT promoter can affect non-canonical processes associated with TERT [ 87; 88; 89; 90 ;  91]. TERT acts as a modulator of Wnt-b-catenin signaling pathway and induces stem cell characteristics in glioma; TERT also regulates expression of NF-kB, a master regulator of inflammation [ 92•; 93 ;  94]. TERT was shown to be important for proliferation of p53-negative cells through ATR mediated stabilization of ETV1, which binds downstream of the transcriptional start site [95]. Other non-canonical functions of TERT include enhanced cell proliferation, decreased apoptosis, regulation of DNA damage responses, chromatin state and increased cellular proliferation life span [ 96; 97 ;  98]. The effect of the mutations beyond transcription also remains a probability. The human TERT promoter contains G-rich sequence and has potential for G-quadruplex formation that can potentially be targeted to regulate gene transcription [ 99]. G-quadruplexes have been also implicated in inhibition of telomerase and control of gene expression [100].  Conceptual advancement and therapeutic possibilities The TERT promoter mutations are thought to represent a conceptual advancement in the sense that those instead of altering an encoded protein modulate transcriptional regulation and represent first evidence of driver alterations in so called ‘dark matter’ of the human genome [ 101• ;  102]. A host of germline variants discovered through genome wide association studies contribute to the susceptibility of various diseases through transcriptional deregulation [103]. While TERT promoter mutations represent novel findings in human cancer, alterations in components associated with telomerase assembly, telomere protection or telomere recruitment are known to impact stem cell function and lifespan in mammals through various disorders [ 104 ;  105].  Several strategies of therapeutic telomerase inhibition including small molecular inhibitors, immunotherapy, gene therapy, telomere and telomerase-proteins in different cancers have entered clinical trial [106]. It will be interesting to see if the TERT promoter mutations, that increase gene expression, influence the current on-going research on targeted therapeutics or if the use of telomerase inhibitors in conjunction with kinase inhibitors like vemurafenib or similar small molecules in melanoma can alleviate recurrent resistance [ 107]. Malignant cells, like all actively growing cells, must maintain their telomeres, but genetic mechanisms responsible for telomere maintenance in tumors have only recently been discovered. In particular, mutations of the telomere binding proteins alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX) or death-domain associated protein (DAXX) have been shown to underlie a telomere maintenance mechanism not involving telomerase (alternative lengthening of telomeres), and point mutations in the promoter of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene increase telomerase expression and have been shown to occur in melanomas and a small number of other tumors. To further define the tumor types in which this latter mechanism plays a role, we surveyed 1,230 tumors of 60 different types. We found that tumors could be divided into types with low (<15%) and high (≥15%) frequencies of TERT promoter mutations. The nine TERT-high tumor types almost always originated in tissues with relatively low rates of self renewal, including melanomas, liposarcomas, hepatocellular carcinomas, urothelial carcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas of the tongue, medulloblastomas, and subtypes of gliomas (including 83% of primary glioblastoma, the most common brain tumor type). TERT and ATRX mutations were mutually exclusive, suggesting that these two genetic mechanisms confer equivalent selective growth advantages. In addition to their implications for understanding the relationship between telomeres and tumorigenesis, TERT mutations provide a biomarker that may be useful for the early detection of urinary tract and liver tumors and aid in the classification and prognostication of brain tumors.  Telomeres are nucleoprotein complexes at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes that are required for chromosomal integrity. Several hundred nucleotides of telomere repeats cap each chromosomal end, and in the absence of telomerase activity, telomeres shorten with each cell division (1). Eventually, uncapped telomeres trigger cell death or senescence. Cancer cells seem to divide ad infinitum and therefore, require some telomere maintenance mechanism to avoid this fate. Because telomerase activity is generally higher in cancer cells than normal cells, it was originally believed that telomerase was somehow activated in cancer cells (2–6). However, it was subsequently realized that telomerase was only inactive in terminally differentiated cells and that normal stem cells in self-renewing tissues retained telomerase activity (1, 7–9). Because normal stem cells must replicate throughout the long lifetimes of mammals (which can be more than a century in humans), it is clear that such cells must also retain telomerase activity. Because normal stem cells are thought to be the progenitors of cancers, there would be no need to specifically activate telomerase in cancer cells; the enzyme was already active in the precursors, just as were the hundreds of other enzymes and proteins normally required for cell proliferation.  This view was challenged by the discovery of another mechanism for maintaining telomere length [i.e., alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT)] (10–12). ALT occurs in the absence of telomerase activity and seems to be dependent on homologous recombination. It occurs in a particularly high fraction of certain tumor types, such as sarcomas, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, and brain tumors, but rarely in most common tumor types, such as those tumor types of the colon, breast, lung, prostate, or pancreas (13). Why would cancer cells need ALT if telomerase activity was already constitutively active in their precursors? This question was highlighted by the discovery that many ALT cancers harbor mutations in alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX) or death-domain associated protein (DAXX), genes encoding proteins that interact with each other at telomeres (10, 11). Presumably, the absence of functional ATRX/DAXX complexes permits the homologous recombination resulting in ALT. At minimum, these data were compatible with the ideas that there could be a selective advantage for genetic alterations that results in telomere maintenance and that telomerase is not indefinitely activated in all normal stem cell precursors of cancers.  Another challenge to the idea that genetic alterations were not required for telomerase activation in cancer was raised by the finding that mutations of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter occurred in ∼70% of melanomas and in a small number of tumor cell lines derived from various tissue types (14, 15). Importantly, only 5 of 110 cell lines derived from lung, stomach, ovary, uterus, or prostate cancers harbored TERT promoter mutations, whereas 19 mutations were found among 37 cell lines derived from various other tumor types. This situation is analogous to the situation for ALT, which is infrequently observed in common epithelial cancers but is observed more regularly in tumors derived from nonepithelial cells, particularly sarcomas and brain tumors (13).  These findings prompted us to formulate a hypothesis about the mechanisms responsible for telomerase activity in cancers. We suggest that there are two ways to maintain telomere lengths as cells divide: (i) through epigenetic regulation of telomerase activity, which occurs in stem cells of tissues that are rapidly renewing, and (ii) through somatic mutations that maintain telomere lengths, such as mutations in the TERT promoter or mutations in DAXX or ATRX. Those cancers that originate in tissues that are constantly self-renewing, such as cancers of the epithelia of the gastrointestinal tract and skin or bone marrow, would be unlikely to harbor telomere-maintaining mutations, because telomerase is already epigenetically activated in their precursor cells. In contrast, tumors arising from cells that are not constantly self-renewing, such as neurons, glial cells, fibroblasts, hepatocytes, islet cells, and pancreatic ductal epithelial cells, might frequently harbor such mutations. A corollary of this hypothesis is that tumor types exhibiting high frequencies of ALT would also exhibit high frequencies of TERT mutations, and these mutations would be distributed in a mutually exclusive fashion. To test these hypotheses as well as answer other questions related to the role of TERT promoter mutations in various cancer types, we determined the prevalence of TERT promoter mutations in a large number of tumors.  Go to: RESULTS We attempted to evaluate at least 20 individual specimens of common tumor types and fewer specimens of rare tumor types, depending on availability of specimens in our laboratories. In those tumor types in which our pilot studies showed a significant number of mutations, additional tumors were evaluated. Melanomas and tumors of the lung, stomach, and esophagus were excluded, because they had already been adequately evaluated in the seminal papers cited (14, 15). When primary tumors rather than cell lines were used, we ensured that the fraction of neoplastic cells was >50% through histopathologic examination of frozen sections of the tissue blocks used for DNA purification. In those cases in which the neoplastic content was <50%, we microdissected the lesions to enrich the neoplastic content to >50%. Primers were designed to amplify the region containing the two TERT mutations that were previously described—C228T and C250T—corresponding to the positions 124 and 146 bp, respectively, upstream of the TERT ATG start site (14, 15). The PCR fragments were then purified and analyzed by conventional Sanger sequencing.  In all, we evaluated TERT promoter mutations in 1,230 tumor specimens and identified 231 mutations (18.8%) (Table 1). C228T and C250T mutations accounted for 77.5% and 20.8% of the alterations, respectively (Dataset S1). Additionally, we detected four mutations that had not been observed previously: three C228A mutations and one C229A mutation (Dataset S1). All four of these mutations as well as a representative subset of the C228T and C250T mutations (n = 59) were somatic, as evidenced by their absence in normal tissues of the patients containing the mutations in their tumors.  Table 1. Table 1. Frequency of TERT promoter mutations The 1,230 tumors represented 60 tumor types. In 26 of these tumor types, at least 15 individual tumors were evaluated (comprising a total of 1,043 individual tumors) (Fig. 1). In the remaining tumor types, only a small number of samples (2–12) was available, in part because these tumor types are generally uncommon in Western populations (Table 1). Among the tumor types in which at least 15 individual tumors were available for study, a clear distinction could be made. Eighteen of these tumor types had only occasional TERT promoter mutations (zero to three mutations, comprising 0–15% of the tumors of each type) (Fig. 1). We classified these tumor types as TERT-low (TERT-L), because they had a low frequency of TERT promoter mutations. Eight other tumor types were classified as TERT-high (TERT-H) because of their relatively high prevalence of TERT promoter mutations (16–83% of the tumors of each type).  Fig. 1. Fig. 1. Frequency of TERT promoter mutations; 15 or more tumors were analyzed in 26 tumor types. Gliomas are divided into primary GBM, astrocytoma (including astrocytoma grades II and III, as well as secondary GBM), and oligodendroglioma. The TERT-L tumor types included some of the most prevalent cancers, including epithelial tumors of the breast, prostate, thyroid, pancreas, gall bladder, uterus, and colon (as well as tumors of the lung, stomach, and esophagus based on prior studies) (14, 15) and leukemias. In fact, no TERT mutations were identified in any specimen of 30 tumor types that we studied, comprising a total of 546 tumors (Table 1). Some nonepithelial cancers, such as synovial sarcomas, chordomas, neuroblastomas, osteosarcomas, and ependymomas, were also TERT-L.  Eight TERT-H tumor types were identified (in addition to the previously described melanomas) (14, 15). These tumors included tumors of the CNS, transitional cell carcinomas of the urinary tract, hepatocellular carcinomas, myxoid liposarcomas, and oral cavity carcinomas. Although only a small number of TERT-H tumors (other than melanomas) were examined in previous studies (15), mutations in gliomas, hepatocellular, and oral cavity carcinomas were detected, which would be expected on the basis of the high frequency of mutation in these tumors types (Table 1).  Clinical and Molecular Correlations in TERT-H Tumors. Sarcomas. One of the highest frequencies of TERT promoter mutation was found in myxoid liposarcoma (19 of 24 tumors, 79% with mutation). Myxoid liposarcomas account for more than one-third of all liposarcomas and ∼10% of all adult soft tissue sarcomas (16). Patients are relatively young, with a peak age range between 30 and 50 y. At the genetic level, the most characteristic change is a t(12;16) (q13;p11) chromosomal translocation that results in the fusion of the FUS and DDIT3 genes (16, 17). The cellular origin of these tumors is unknown, but preadipocytic progenitor cells and mesenchymal stem cells have been implicated (18); after embryogenesis, the mitotic activity of these cells is thought to be low. Other sarcomas, also thought to originate from mesenchymal cells that do not self-renew in the absence of damage, were not TERT-H (Table 1). These sarcomas included synovial sarcomas (0% of 16 tumors) and osteosarcomas (4.3% of 23 tumors). Of note, myxoid liposarcomas have been previously shown to have a relatively high prevalence of ALT (24% of 38 tumors) (13, 19). The data, in aggregate, are compatible with the idea that myxoid liposarcomas almost always genetically activate telomere maintenance genes through either TERT promoter mutations or ALT.  Hepatocellular carcinomas. Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) are the third leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide, and their incidence is increasing in the United States (20). Most HCCs in the United States are associated with Hepatitis B or C Virus infection, whereas others are associated with alcoholic cirrhosis; 44% of HCC samples that we evaluated harbored TERT promoter mutations (27/61). This finding makes TERT the most commonly mutated gene yet observed in this tumor type (21, 22). The mutations seemed to occur relatively early in tumorigenesis, because they were observed in 39% of stage I well-differentiated HCCs (Table S1). TERT mutations were observed in virally associated tumors as well as cases without any underlying liver disease at similar frequencies (Table S1). There was also no difference in the prevalence of TERT promoter mutations with respect to sex, age, or ethnicity (Table S1). ALT has been observed in 7% of 121 HCCs studied previously (13).  Urinary tract cancers. Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder is the fourth most common type of cancer in American males. In 2013, over 73,000 patients will be diagnosed with bladder cancer leading to approximately 15,000 deaths in the US alone (23). Two-thirds of the 21 urothelial carcinomas of the bladder that we studied harbored TERT promoter mutations. We were also able to evaluate 19 urothelial carcinomas of the upper urinary tract, a much less common anatomic site for this histopathologic subtype of tumor. Nine of nineteen upper urinary tract urothelial carcinomas harbored TERT mutations. TERT mutations are, therefore, the most frequently mutated genes yet identified in urothelial carcinoma of either the bladder or upper urinary tract (24). The prevalence of ALT in bladder cancers is very low (1% of 188 cancers) (13).  Head and neck cancers. Head and neck cancers are almost always squamous cell carcinomas and can occur throughout the oral cavity lining (mucous membranes of the cheek, hard and soft palate, tongue, supraglottis, etc.). It is the sixth most common cancer in the world, and 50,000 cases occurred in the United States in 2012. We identified TERT promoter mutations in 17% of 70 oral cavity cancers that we evaluated. However, the anatomic distribution of the cases with TERT promoter mutations was striking: 11 of 12 cancers with TERT promoter mutations were in the oral tongue, although only 23 of 70 total cases originated in the oral tongue (P < 0.0001, Fisher exact probability test, two-tailed) (Table S2). The basis for this extraordinary selectivity is curious given the shared characteristics of the squamous epithelium lining the tongue and other parts of the head and neck, including the oral cavity. Moreover, we evaluated 22 squamous cell carcinomas of another site (the cervix) and found only one TERT mutation (4.5%) (Table 1). Most cervical squamous cell carcinomas and a subset of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas are caused by human papillomavirus, which can activate telomerase by expressing E6 and E7 viral oncogenes (25). These findings raise the possibility that human papillomavirus infection and TERT mutation may be alternative mechanisms to activate telomerase among squamous cell carcinomas. We were unable to test correlations between TERT promoter mutations and HPV status or other clinical parameters because of the small number of patients with available data (Table S2). There have been no ALT cases identified among 70 head and neck cancers, including 41 oral cavity cancers (13).  Medulloblastomas. Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor of childhood (26). TERT mutations occurred in 21% of 91 medulloblastomas that we evaluated. As with the oral cavity cancers, TERT mutations were not distributed randomly among the medulloblastoma patients. Although medulloblastomas are usually diagnosed at a young age, those medulloblastomas with TERT mutations were diagnosed at a considerably older age (median = 6 vs. 16 y, P = 0.0012, t test assuming unequal variances, two-tailed) (Fig. S1A). This observation has important implications for understanding the basis for the selectivity of the tumor types harboring TERT promoter mutations (Discussion); 45 of 90 patients had been assessed previously for orthodenticle homeobox 2 (OTX2) gene amplification and expression, and alterations in this transcription factor are known to correlate with clinically distinct molecular subtypes of medulloblastoma (27). OTX2 expression was >100-fold higher in medulloblastoma patients without TERT promoter mutations than in those patients with TERT promoter mutations (note the log scale in Fig. S1B). The high levels of OTX2 expression were usually the result of OTX2 gene amplification (Fig. S1C). The association of TERT promoter mutations with an older age at diagnosis and a lack of OTX2 overexpression raises the possibility that TERT mutations occur in a specific clinical and molecular subtype of medulloblastoma. The most likely molecular subtype of medulloblastoma that may be enriched for TERT mutations is the noninfant sonic hedgehog subtype, which is characterized by an older age at diagnosis and lower expression of OTX2 (28, 29). Larger studies will be needed to make this association more definitive. ALT has been observed in 7% of 55 medulloblastomas studied previously (13).  Gliomas. Gliomas are the most common CNS tumor type and accounted for >14,000 deaths in the United States last year (30). Histopathological and clinical criteria established by the World Health Organization are used to characterize these tumors into several subtypes (30). We considered the four main subtypes individually (Table S3).  Primary glioblastoma. These primary glioblastomas (GBMs) are the most common malignant brain tumors in adults, accounting for ∼17% of all intracranial tumors, and they confer the worst survival (median of ∼15 mo) (31). These high-grade (grade IV) tumors have no detectable precursor lesions and have been referred to as de novo tumors. The prevalence of TERT promoter mutations was remarkably high in GBMs of adults (83% of 78 tumors) (Table S3). This prevalence is higher than the prevalence of any other genetic mutation in this tumor type (32). These findings provide a molecular mechanism responsible for the high levels of TERT mRNA and telomerase activity observed in GBMs (33).  For 51 of 78 primary GBM tumors, data on other common genetic alterations as well as clinical data were available (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, EGFR amplification, a classic molecular feature of primary GBM, exclusively occurred in tumors with TERT mutations (P = 0.0006, Fisher exact probability test, two-tailed). Conversely, no association was identified between TERT mutation and either TP53 mutation or CDKN2A deletion. Importantly, the frequency of TERT promoter mutations was considerably less in primary GBMs of pediatric patients (11% of 19 tumors) than adult patients (Discussion) (Table S3). ALT was observed in 11% of 105 adult GBM and 44% of pediatric GBM (i.e., the reverse of the pattern observed for TERT promoter mutations) (13). Primary GBM patients without TERT mutations survived considerably longer, on average, than patients with such mutations (median = 27 vs. 14 mo, P = 0.01 by the log rank test) (Fig. S3).  Fig. 2.

(A) Distribution of TERT mutations and other genetic events in 51 primary GBMs. (B) Distribution of TERT mutations and other genetic events among 40 astrocytomas, including grades II–III astrocytomas ... Astrocytomas. Infiltrative astrocytic tumors frequently progress, with recurrent lesions often of higher grade than the original lesions excised at surgery. They are most often grade II or III but can progress to grade IV (at which point they are often termed secondary GBMs). Astrocytomas of any stage rarely contained TERT promoter mutations (10% of 40 total samples) (Table S3). Instead, they more frequently contained isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) or isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) mutations (75% of 40 tumors), ATRX mutations (70% of 40 tumors), and TP53 mutations (73% of 40 tumors) (Fig. 2B). ALT has been observed in 63% of 57 astrocytomas, consistent with the high prevalence of ATRX mutations (13). The lack of activating TERT mutations in IDH1 mutant tumors is also corroborated by the lack of TERT mRNA and telomerase activity observed in these lesions (33).  Oligodendrogliomas. Like astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas often progress, and they frequently contain TERT promoter mutations (78% of 45 tumor samples) (Table S3). Oligodendroglioma was the only tumor type studied (of all types, including non-CNS tumors) (Dataset S1) in which C250T mutations were nearly as frequent as C228T mutations. In oligodendrogliomas, 43% of tumors with TERT mutations contained C250T substitutions, whereas in other gliomas, only 10% did (P < 0.001, Fisher exact probability test, two-tailed). Interestingly, 91% of 45 oligodendrogliomas that were evaluated for ATRX and TERT sequence alterations contained either an ATRX coding or a TERT promoter mutation, suggesting that genetic alterations resulting in telomere maintenance are required for tumorigenesis of this subtype.  Oligodendrogliomas have long been known to contain characteristic losses of chromosome arms 1p and 19q, and these losses reflect inactivation of the CIC gene on chromosome 19q and in some cases, inactivation of the FUBP1 gene on chromosome 1p (34–36). Accordingly, 78% of 45 oligodendrogliomas contained chromosome arm 1p or 19q losses of heterozygosity (Fig. 2C) (34–36). Moreover, nearly all of them contained IDH1 or IDH2 mutations (93%).  Oligoastrocytomas. As their name implies, these tumors are mixed, with histologic features of both oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas. This mixture, in part, reflects the difficulties in distinguishing the various glioma subtypes from one another on the basis of histopathologic or clinical criteria (37). The genetic features of this tumor subtype reflect this mixture: the prevalence of TERT promoter mutations (25% of 24 tumors) was intermediate between oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas, as were the frequencies of chromosome (Chr) 1p/19q losses and IDH1/2, TP53, and ATRX mutations (Fig. 2D).  ALT Vs. TERT. ALT has been observed in tumors of the CNS (particularly gliomas) more frequently than tumors of any other tissue type. Given that TERT promoter mutations are also common in gliomas, the relationship between these two features could be determined with high confidence. The tumors depicted in Fig. 2 had previously been evaluated for alterations in ATRX, which is a nearly perfect surrogate for the ALT phenotype (11, 37). Our data show that there were 50 gliomas with ATRX mutations and 83 gliomas with TERT mutations; 0 of 83 tumors with TERT mutations contained ATRX mutations (P < 0.0001, Fisher exact probability test, two-tailed).  Go to: DISCUSSION The results described above, as well as the results published in refs. 14 and 15, provide evidence that supports one of the hypotheses raised in the Introduction and refutes others. The first of these hypotheses was that TERT mutations would only be observed in tumors derived from tissues that are not constantly self-renewing under normal circumstances. This hypothesis was supported in part: the vast majority of TERT promoter mutations occurred in tumors derived from tissues that do not continually self-renew. The TERT-H tumor types include only melanomas, certain subtypes of glioma, medulloblastomas, squamous cell cancers of the tongue, liposarcomas, HCCs, and urinary tract cancers. The normal transitional cells of the urinary tract have very low proliferative indices (0.64% ± 0.52%), much lower than indices of gastrointestinal tract, bone marrow, or skin (38). Normal hepatocytes also do not turnover often (39), and glial cells are thought to have limited capacity for self-renewal (40).  Two other observations also support the hypothesis. Pediatric primary GBMs rarely contained TERT mutations (11%), whereas adult primary GBMs frequently did (83%). Pediatric GBMs are presumably derived from cells that are still dividing at the time of tumor initiation, and therefore, there is no selective advantage conferred by activating telomerase through a genetic mutation. Adult GBMs, in contrast, are presumably derived from postmitotic cells, and they should require telomerase activation. Similarly, medulloblastomas are embryonal tumors that typically arise from precursor cells with high self-renewal rates that do not usually persist in adults. This finding is consistent with our observation that the mean age of medulloblastoma patients with TERT mutations was considerably older than the mean age of medulloblastoma patients without TERT mutations (Fig. S1A).  There are, however, exceptions that belie the hypothesis that TERT mutations occur only in non–self-renewing tissues. The epithelium that lines the tongue constantly self-renews, but many squamous carcinomas of the tongue harbored TERT mutations (Table S2). Additionally, the squamous epithelia of the tongue certainly would not be expected to self-renew less than other squamous epithelia of the oral cavity, but the latter rarely harbored TERT mutations (Table S2). This finding may suggest that squamous carcinomas of the tongue originate from a different cell of origin than other oral cavity squamous carcinomas. Conversely, only a subset of the tumor types derived from non–self-renewing tissues was TERT-H. For example, the TERT-H tumors included myxoid liposarcomas but not synovial sarcomas. Moreover, cells of the pancreas (the islets of Langerhans and the ductal epithelial cells) rarely renew, but pancreatic tumors of all types (pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, acinar carcinomas, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas) were all TERT-L. The most that we can conclude at present is that non–self-renewing cell types are the major sources of TERT-H tumors but that non–self-renewal is only one of the factors that determines whether tumor cells with TERT promoter mutations will have a selective growth advantage over adjoining cells.  The first corollary to the hypothesis raised in the Introduction was that tumor types that displayed ALT would be those types that harbored TERT promoter mutations. This corollary is soundly refuted by these data, at least in general terms. Although tumor types of the CNS and liposarcomas had high frequencies of ALT as well as high frequencies of TERT promoter mutations, these tumor types were the exceptions rather than the rule. For example, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors have very high frequencies of ALT but no evidence of TERT mutations. Conversely, bladder cancers frequently have TERT mutations but never have ALT (13). Additionally, even among gliomas, pediatric GBMs have high frequencies of ALT and low frequencies of TERT mutations, whereas adult GBMs have the reverse pattern.  The second corollary was that the selective advantage afforded by TERT mutation would be equivalent to the advantage afforded by ATRX mutation (conferring ALT). This hypothesis was most effectively tested in gliomas, in which both ATRX coding and TERT promoter mutations were common. There was a striking mutual exclusivity with respect to ATRX and TERT mutations (P < 0.0001), lending strong support to this idea.  These results also raise many unanswered questions. In some tumor types, such as gliomas, we can imagine that all tumors have genetically activated telomere maintenance programs through mutations in either TERT or ATRX. However, in other tumor types with frequent ATRX mutations, such as pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, what is responsible for activating telomerase in the fraction of cases not exhibiting ALT if it is not a mutation in the TERT promoter? Similarly, what is responsible for activating telomerase in those tumors derived from non–self-renewing cell types in which neither ALT nor TERT mutations is frequently observed, such as synovial sarcomas or osteosarcomas? Also, there are occasional individual tumors among the TERT-L types that have TERT promoter mutations (e.g., cervical cancers, ovarian cancers, and in ref. 15, lung cancers). What distinguishes these occasional cancers from others of the same histopathologic subtype? Whole-genome sequencing studies, rather than those studies limited to the exome, might provide answers to these questions.  The results recorded here have practical as well as basic scientific implications. Two-thirds of bladder cancers had TERT promoter mutations, making it the most commonly mutated gene yet identified in invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. Given the persistently high mortality rate despite multimodality treatment in this group of patients, these mutations represent ideal urinary biomarkers to detect bladder cancers at an early stage and to follow patients for evidence of progression or recurrence once they have been diagnosed (41). Similarly, the high prevalence of TERT promoter mutations in HCCs and glioma subtypes provides excellent candidate biomarkers for early detection (HCC) or monitoring (HCC in the plasma and gliomas in the cerebrospinal fluid) (42, 43).  Another practical implication involves diagnostics. We conjecture that tumors with TERT promoter or ATRX mutations are derived from different precursor cells and that either type of precursor cell is different from those types that are the precursors of tumors without such mutations. This distinction could aid classification of the tumors in clinically meaningful ways. For example, Fig. 2 and Fig. S2 outline the major genetic alterations occurring in the three most common types of gliomas. On the basis of the data in Fig. 2 A–C, we speculate that oligodendrogliomas that lack TERT mutations but contain ATRX mutations may behave more like astrocytomas than oligodendrogliomas and vice versa. Similarly, the primary GBMs without TERT mutations (15% of the total) may behave more like advanced progressive astrocytomas, which generally lack TERT mutations. This possibility is supported by the observation that those primary GBM patients without TERT mutations had a longer survival, on average, than other primary GBM patients (Fig. S3).  Go to: METHODS All clinical information and tissue were obtained with consent and Institutional Review Board approval from the various institutions donating material to this study, and they were obtained in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Tissue sections were reviewed by board-certified pathologists to ensure that ≥50% of the cells used for DNA purification were neoplastic and confirm histopathological diagnosis. Oligonucleotides with the sequences 5′-M13-GGCCGATTCGACCTCTCT-3′ and 5′-AGCACCTCGCGGTAGTGG-3′, where M13 is a universal sequencing priming site with sequence 5′-tgtaaaacgacggccagt-3′, were used to PCR-amplify the proximal TERT promoter containing C228 and C250 (chr5: 1,295,228; chr5: 1,295,250, respectively; hg19) for Sanger sequencing using standard methods (44). Primary GBM copy number data as well as ALT status were derived from the data published in refs. 37, 45, and 46, and OTX2 copy number expression was derived from the data published in ref. 27. Brain tumor patients were treated at the Tisch Brain Tumor Center at Duke. For the purposes of this study, secondary GBM designates a GBM that was resected >1 y after a prior diagnosis of a lower-grade glioma (grades I–III), and all other GBMs were considered to be primary GBMs. Pediatric GBM samples were defined as those samples occurring before 21 y of age.
