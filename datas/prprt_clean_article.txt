48 ||  hnscc is not characterized by frequent kinase mutations, in contrast to some malignancies where mutational activation of kinases upstream of stat3 is common.  instead, stat3 may be activated by loss-of-function (lof) of negative regulators of stat3, including by promoter hypermethylation of ptprt.  here we first analyzed the cancer genome atlas (tcga) data and determined that the ptprt promoter is frequently hypermethylated in several cancers, including hnscc (% of tumors analyzed) in association with downregulation of ptprt mrna expression and upregulation of pstat3 expression. 4 importantly, pstat3 is a validated direct substrate of ptprt, and lof mutations of ptprt lead to increased pstat3 expression and enhanced hnscc cell growth/survival.  4, 5 as these lof ptprt mutations are found in relatively few hnscc tumors (% of tumors analyzed), we sought to determine if loss of ptprt expression by aberrant promoter methylation contributes to pstat3 overexpression and sensitivity to stat3 inhibition in hnsc  herein, we report a high frequency of aberrant ptprt promoter hypermethylation in hnscc and other cancers.  we demonstrate that ptprt promoter methylation significantly downregulates ptprt expression, with an associated increase in expression of the ptprt substrate pstat3 in hnsc we show that this methylation is reversible, leading to specific downregulation of pstat3 in hnscc cells. further, we demonstrate a correlation between ptprt promoter methylation and sensitivity to stat3 inhibition in hnscc cell lines, suggesting that ptprt methylation may serve as a predictive biomarker of responsiveness to stat3 inhibitors currently in clinical development.   go to: results frequent ptprt promoter hypermethylation leads to decreased ptprt mrna expression  to assess aberrant ptprt promoter methylation in hnscc, we analyzed tcga data derived from the illumina humanmethylation450 platform.  we first determined which cg dinucleotide methylation event was most negatively correlated with ptprt mrna expression (figure 1a). in contrast, copy number alterations of the ptprt gene are relatively infrequent and are not significantly associated with altered ptprt mrna expression (supplemental figure 1).  as human papilloma virus (hpv) infection is an etiologic and prognostic factor in a subset of hnscc, we sought to determine if ptprt promoter hypermethylation is associated with hpv status and observed no significant association (p = , fisher’s exact test; ptprt promoter hypermethylation in 21/36 [%] hpv-positive tumors versus 145/243 [%] hpv-negative tumors), suggesting that hpv infection is not a driver of ptprt promoter methylation.  6  figure 1 figure 1 frequent ptprt promoter hypermethylation is associated with downregulation of ptprt mrna in hnscc tumors in order to validate tcga findings in an independent hnscc human cohort, we performed methylation-specific pcr (msp) on 45 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded oral squamous cell cancers with primers directed at the promoter region of ptprt (representative analysis in figure 2a). using this semi-quantitative analysis, a similar high frequency of methylation was observed in this cohort (%, 32/45 tumors analyzed; figure 2b), further suggesting that ptprt promoter methylation represents a common mechanism of ptprt downregulation in hnsc  figure 2 figure 2 the ptprt promoter is frequently methylated in an independent cohort of hnscc tumors the ptprt promoter is frequently hypermethylated across human cancers  further analysis of tcga data reveals that the ptprt promoter is frequently hypermethylated across a broad array of cancer types when hypermethylation is defined as a fractional methylation level (beta value) at least three standard deviations above the mean methylation level of the same genetic locus in organ-matched normal tissue samples.  the highest incidence of ptprt promoter hypermethylation occurs in colon adenocarcinoma (%, 289/367 tumors analyzed), while hnscc exhibits the second highest incidence (%) (figure 3a).  of the cancers analyzed, four exhibit significant downregulation of ptprt mrna in hypermethylated tumors (hnscc, colon adenocarcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, and breast invasive carcinoma; p < ), suggesting a functional role for aberrant ptprt promoter methylation across several cancer types (figure 3b).  figure 5 figure 5 ptprt promoter methylation is reduced by 5-azacytidine treatment, leading to ptprt-specific pstat3 downregulation in hnscc cells ptprt promoter methylation is associated with increased sensitivity to stat3 inhibition in hnscc cells  to evaluate whether ptprt promoter methylation may serve as a predictive biomarker for stat3 targeted therapies, we first determined ec50 values for selective stat3 inhibitors in a panel of 8 hnscc cell lines (figures 6a and 6b) that exhibit varying levels of ptprt promoter methylation as determined by msp (summarized in figures 6c and 6d).  figures 6e and 6f illustrate that ptprt promoter methylation and sensitivity to stattic (a stat3 sh2 domain inhibitor) or jsi-124 (a jak/stat3 pathway inhibitor) are significantly correlated (p < ), indicating that hnscc tumors that exhibit ptprt promoter hypermethylation may be most sensitive to treatment with stat3 inhibitors.  a similar trend was observed with the jak2 inhibitor ly2784544, though this observation was not statistically significant (supplemental figure 2). notably, we observe no direct correlation between ptprt promoter methylation and pstat3 expression in this cell line panel, suggesting that high pstat3 expression per se may not be predictive of sensitivity to stat3 inhibitors.  thus, inhibition of stat3 directly rather than through upstream kinases may be more efficacious in tumors with ptprt promoter hypermethylation.   figure 6 figure 6 increased ptprt promoter methylation is associated with increased sensitivity to stat3 inhibition we next sought to determine whether ptprt methylation may serve as a predictive biomarker of sensitivity to stat3 inhibition in a heterotopic tumorgraft model of hnsc we inoculated 16 nude mice with 3×106 bicr 18 cells (which exhibit total ptprt unmethylation) on one flank, and 3×106 umscc 1 cells (which exhibit near total ptprt methylation) on the other flank.  here we report that the ptprt promoter is frequently hypermethylated in hnscc and other cancers in association with decreased ptprt expression.  a high rate of ptprt promoter hypermethylation has also been reported in sporadic colorectal cancer, where nearly all tumors analyzed were methylated in contrast to no observed methylation in matched normal tissues, as well as in hepatocellular carcinoma, where the ptprt methylation levels progressively increase from adjacent tissue to tumor.  10, 11 our present findings indicate that ptprt promoter methylation may represent a common event across many cancer types, suggesting that the development of a therapeutic strategy informed by this event may be of wide clinical benefit.
50 ||  we identified 5 tumor-specific mutations that are located in the two domains (2).  among these five mutations, the f74s mutation is located in the mam domain and the other four mutations (a209t, k218t, f248s and y280h) are located in the ig domain ( 4a).  to test whether these mutations affect their ability to mediate cell-cell aggregation in sf9 cells, we engineered the five mutations by site-directed mutagenesis using the full-length ptpρ baculoviral construct as the template. quantitatively, the levels of cell surface expression of the 5 tumor-derived ptpρ mutations were similar to that of wild-type protein.  if the cell surface expression level (cse value) of wild-type ptpρ is arbitrarily assigned as 1, the cse values of f74s, a209t, k218t, f248s and y280h mutations were , , ,  and  respectively.  interestingly, some ptpρ mutants that contain the extracellular domain but are unable to mediate cell-cell aggregation are expressed at higher levels on the sf9 cell surface than wild-type ptpρ. five tumor-derived mutations of ptpρ are located in the two domains and all of them can be mapped to equivalent residues in the mam and ig domain structure of ptpμ.  based on the crystal structure, the authors predicted that 4 of them (f74s, a209t, f248s and y280h) would cause significant perturbation of the structure of ptprt, because these mutations dramatically alter the character of buried side-chains (17).  moreover, the fifth mutation k218t is located on the surface of the ig domain and the authors predicted that this mutation would directly alter protein-protein interactions (17). our data indicated that the k218t mutation affects the size of aggregates and only a small effect on the percentage of cells incorporated into the aggregates, suggesting that the k218t mutant may decrease the binding affinity of ptpρ.  interestingly, the other four mutations significantly reduce the percentage of aggregation, therefore, these data suggest that the f74s, a209t, f248s and y280h mutations dramatically alter the domain structure and lead to perturbation of the homophilic interaction of ptpρ.  our previous studies showed that the tumor-derived phosphatase domain mutations of ptpρ diminish its phosphatase activity and overexpression of ptpρ suppresses the growth of colorectal cancer cells, indicating that ptpρ normally act as a tumor suppressor (2).

52 ||  in addition, the effects of none of the mutations reported in this manuscript on protein thermodynamic stability has been previously investigated.   go to: results four mutations of the ptpρ membrane-proximal catalytic domain in public databases have been identified: d927g, q987k, n1128i and a1118 introduction of these mutations resulted in soluble recombinant protein only for d927g, q987k and n1128i whereas the a1118p mutant could not be expressed in the soluble fraction even when different growth and induction conditions were used.  mapping of the mutations onto the structure of the ptpρ catalytic domain revealed that a1118p is located in the middle of a central helix ( 1). this residue is located in a very polar environment with flanking acidic (e1124, e1127, e1129) and a histidine residue (h974) located in a neighbouring loop region.  d927g and q987k are located in solvent exposed loops with little interaction with other amino acid side chains ( 1c).  the solvent accessibility of the mutated residues asp-927 and gln-987 is more than 70% and asn-1128 is 49% solvent exposed.  the mutation d927g involves a residue (asp-927) placed in a 4 residues turn between two coils.  in the wild-type asp-927 connects different protein secondary structure regions through hydrogen bonds with three residues. spectroscopic characterization of ptpρ wild-type and its mutants  the near-uv cd spectrum of wild-type ptpρ shows the contribution of all aromatic residues and is characterized by two negative components centred at 280 nm and at around 298 nm accompanied by fine structure features at 275–280 nm ( 2a).  q987k variant displays a near-uv cd spectrum almost identical to that of the wild-type as well as d927g and n1128i, which nevertheless show a slight decrease of the dichroic activity at 275–280 nm.  in line with the near-uv cd results, which suggest a similar tertiary arrangement for the wild-type and all the variants, the fluorescence emission spectra of mutants are similar to that of wild-type protein, being all centred at the same maximum emission wavelength around 338 nm but characterized by a decreased emission fluorescence intensity ( 2b).  figure 2 figure 2 spectroscopic properties of ptpρ wild-type and mutants.  thermal unfolding  the thermal stability of d927g, q987k and n1128i was investigated by continuously monitoring the ellipticity changes at 209 nm between 10 and 72°c in comparison with that of wild-type ( 3).  the parameter chosen to compare the transition curves of ptpρ wild-type and mutants is the melting temperature (tm) defined as the mid point of the denaturation process calculated by plotting the first derivative of the molar ellipticity values as a function of temperature ( 3, inset).  the temperature-induced ellipticity changes at 209 nm, where the main amplitude was observed, occur in an apparent cooperative transition for ptpρ wild-type, q987k, n1128i and d927g, and with apparent tm values of , ,  and °c, respectively.  the temperature-induced ellipticity changes for wild type and mutants are all coincident with the heat-induced increase of the photomultiplier tube voltage (pmtv) above 370 v ( 3b), suggesting that the temperature-induced unfolding is accompanied by protein aggregation [25]. temperature dependence of phosphatase activity  the temperature dependence of phosphatase activity of ptpρ wild-type and variants was examined over the temperature range of 10–42°c ( 4a).  the optimal temperatures were estimated to be at 37°c for wild type and q987k, at around 33°c for n1128i and at 30°c for d927g ( 4a).  notably, at 37°c, the phosphatase activity of all ptpρ variants is significantly reduced and corresponds to 72, 54 and 20% of that of the wild-type protein for q987k, n1128i and d927g, respectively. the activation energy, ea‡, determined by the arrhenius equation (1) in the temperature range between 10°c and the optimal temperature of each protein, corresponds to ± kcal/mol for the wild-type and to ±, ± and ± kcal/mol for n1128i, d927g and q987k ( 4b), respectively.  this result suggests an increased flexibility of all the variants compared to the wild-type, particularly evident for n1128i and d927g whose phosphatase activity is significantly decreased at 42° the comparison of temperature dependence of phosphatase activity with the structural thermal unfolding monitored at 209 nm clearly indicates that the d927g and n1128i variants are significantly more flexible and less thermal resistant than the wild-type.   figure 4 figure 4 effect of temperature on phosphatase activity of ptpρ wild-type and mutants.jpg averaged changes ( 6 a and b).  the folding intermediate detected by relative fluorescence intensity is populated at around  m urea for wild-type and q987k and at around  m urea for d927g and n1128i.  the intrinsic fluorescence emission spectra of the folding intermediate are similar for all the proteins: the fluorescence intensity is increased of about  fold and the maximum emission wavelength is shifted from 338 to 345 nm, with respect to the native state ( 5).  the transitions monitored by relative fluorescence intensity changes ( 6b) were fitted to a three-state unfolding process which yielded the thermodynamic parameters for wild-type and the variants of ptpρ (table 1).  for the first transition, m values are all closely similar to that of the wild-type, suggesting a similar unfolding mechanism for all the variants; δg values lower than that of the wild-type are observed for n1128i and d927g, suggesting a destabilization of the native state for these two variants, that also show a decreased thermal stability (see  3 and and4). 4).  table 1 table 1 thermodynamic parameters for urea-induced unfolding equilibrium of ptpρwild-type and mutants.  the near-uv cd changes of d927g, the most temperature sensitive variant, upon increasing urea concentrations were monitored in comparison with wild-type ( 7) to better characterize the nature of the intermediate state.  the resulting data were analyzed after removal of the high-frequency noise and the low-frequency random error by a singular value decomposition algorithm (svd) which resolved two main spectra components either for wild-type or for the mutant d927g.  the most significant singular values were ×103 for wild-type and ×103 for d927g, the second singular values were % and % of the first singular value for wild-type and d927g, respectively.  the plots of the first (v1) and of the second column (v2) of the v matrix which reflect the global change in the 250–320 nm region as a function of urea concentration show non-two state transition profiles comparable to the transitions monitored by intrinsic fluorescence emission intensity and confirm the accumulation of an intermediate at around  m urea ( 7 b, and c).  at this denaturant concentration, the near-uv cd spectra of wild-type and d927g significantly differ from those of the native state and are completely opposite in sign ( 7a).  the 298 nm negative band is lost and a positive contribution at 289 nm is present in the spectra of the intermediate state of both proteins. furthermore, the 280–260 nm region, dominated by contribution of phe and tyr residues, in d927g is less defined than the wild-type ( 7a).  the data clearly indicate that both the spectral components of the wild-type and d927g contribute to the urea induced transitions with the accumulation of a denaturation intermediate at the same urea concentration range observed by monitoring intrinsic fluorescence intensity ( 5 and  6b).   figure 7 figure 7 effect of urea on near-uv cd spectra of ptpρ wild-type and d927g. the most significant singular values are very similar for wild-type and all the variants and range between ×105 and ×105.  the second singular values are % of the first singular value for the wild-type, % for the d927g variant, % for q987k and % for n1128i.  all the other singular values are below % of the largest singular value and progressively decrease approaching to zero. thus the data have been globally fitted to a two-state model according to equation 4 with the m parameter shared between all the data sets.  the free energy of unfolding, δgh2o, of wild-type and mutants obtained from the global fitting are very similar and correspond to ±, ±, ± and ± kcal/mol for wild-type, n1128i, d927g and q987 k, respectively, for a shared m value of ± kcal/mol/m.  equilibrium unfolding of ptpρ wild-type and variants occurs via a hyperfluorescent intermediate state that cannot be detected by far-uv cd. the d1 domain is a monomeric, structurally independent and stable folding unit characterized by a high thermodynamic stability.  in this study, we selected ptpρ mutations of d1 domain found in colorectal cancers [10] and reported in nssnp database [14], d927g, q987k, a1118p and n1128i.  all the mutants are expressed as soluble recombinant proteins, except a1118p which remains insoluble also upon different growth and induction conditions.  the spectroscopic properties of the wild-type compared with those of all the variants indicate that the mutations d927g, q987k and n1128i had no effect on protein secondary structure with minor modifications of tertiary arrangements.   all the mutants show a decrease in the thermal stability and in the activation energy for phosphatase activity with respect to the wild-type indicating an increase in protein flexibility of all the mutants. hence, at 37°c the phosphatase activity of all the variants was significantly reduced, similarly to what reported by wang  for q987k and n1128i [10].  the most destabilizing mutation, d927g, yielded a protein that at physiological temperature was almost completely inactive.   all the mutations studied here are located at very diverse positions in the structure, distant from the catalytic site and, except a1118p, in solvent-exposed loop regions. presumably, the change in main chain flexibility caused by the most destabilizing d927g mutation may lead to local disorder and may affect the stabilizing hydrogen bonds of residues in close proximity (asp-947, lys-930 and glu-931).  this hypothesis is in agreement with the changes in local environment of aromatic residues suggested by the comparison of the near-uv cd spectrum of d927g with that of the wild-type.  the n1128i mutation is less destabilizing than d927g.  all the variants, as revealed by intrinsic fluorescence emission intensity, show three-state equilibrium unfolding transitions similar to that of the wild-type, with the accumulation of a hyperfluorescent intermediate at ∼ m urea that retains 35% of the native secondary structure ellipticity.  the hyperfluorescent intermediate of wild-type and of d927g, the most temperature sensitive variant, contains tertiary contacts, although the packing of aromatic side-chains appears different from that of the native state.   the reversibility of the urea-induced unfolding equilibrium at low temperature allows a quantitative determination of the effect of mutations on the thermodynamic parameters of ptpρ catalytic domain. the destabilizing effect of mutations caused by nssnps on ptpρ thermodynamic stability (table 1) may be referred i) to a destabilization of the native state for n1128i and d927g, as indicated by the values of δgh2oi-n lower than that of the wild-type, and ii) to a stabilization of the intermediate for all the variants, as suggested by the higher free energy of unfolding from the intermediate to the unfolded state (δgh2ou-i), with respect to that of the wild-type (table 1).  the destabilizing effect of d927g and n1128i substitutions is also evident from the decrease in melting temperature monitored by secondary structure changes and from the significant reduction of phosphatase activity at 37°c that suggests a higher flexibility of the two variants with respect to the wild-type.   the reversible equilibrium unfolding transitions monitored by far-uv cd are not coincident with those monitored by near-uv cd and intrinsic

54 ||  we identified 5 tumor-specific mutations that are located in the two domains (2).  among these five mutations, the f74s mutation is located in the mam domain and the other four mutations (a209t, k218t, f248s and y280h) are located in the ig domain ( 4a).  to test whether these mutations affect their ability to mediate cell-cell aggregation in sf9 cells, we engineered the five mutations by site-directed mutagenesis using the full-length ptpρ baculoviral construct as the template. quantitatively, the levels of cell surface expression of the 5 tumor-derived ptpρ mutations were similar to that of wild-type protein.  if the cell surface expression level (cse value) of wild-type ptpρ is arbitrarily assigned as 1, the cse values of f74s, a209t, k218t, f248s and y280h mutations were , , ,  and  respectively.  interestingly, some ptpρ mutants that contain the extracellular domain but are unable to mediate cell-cell aggregation are expressed at higher levels on the sf9 cell surface than wild-type ptpρ. five tumor-derived mutations of ptpρ are located in the two domains and all of them can be mapped to equivalent residues in the mam and ig domain structure of ptpμ.  based on the crystal structure, the authors predicted that 4 of them (f74s, a209t, f248s and y280h) would cause significant perturbation of the structure of ptprt, because these mutations dramatically alter the character of buried side-chains (17).  moreover, the fifth mutation k218t is located on the surface of the ig domain and the authors predicted that this mutation would directly alter protein-protein interactions (17). our data indicated that the k218t mutation affects the size of aggregates and only a small effect on the percentage of cells incorporated into the aggregates, suggesting that the k218t mutant may decrease the binding affinity of ptpρ.  interestingly, the other four mutations significantly reduce the percentage of aggregation, therefore, these data suggest that the f74s, a209t, f248s and y280h mutations dramatically alter the domain structure and lead to perturbation of the homophilic interaction of ptpρ.  our previous studies showed that the tumor-derived phosphatase domain mutations of ptpρ diminish its phosphatase activity and overexpression of ptpρ suppresses the growth of colorectal cancer cells, indicating that ptpρ normally act as a tumor suppressor (2).

56 ||  ptprt was previously found to reverse tyr705 phosphorylation on stat3, a modification associated with stat3 deactivation. 12 in this novel mutation, a highly conserved hydrophobic valine residue is converted into methionine (v995m).  the mutation occurs in the cytoplasmic part of the protein, within the catalytically active tyrosine-protein phosphatase 1 domain (figure 1e).  the ptprt v995m mutation could therefore affect stat3 activity by reducing dephosphorylation of tyr705, thus increasing the expression of stat3 target genes.   mutations affecting t-cell survival and activation  patient 2 was diagnosed with lgl leukemia at the age of 76 years and harbored a major t-cell clone that constituted 73% of all cd8+ cells (figure 2a).4 similarly, in this study, we showed that stat3 was also phosphorylated in lgl patients without actual stat3 mutations, and that lgl leukemia patients clustered closely together in the rna expression analysis independently of their mutational status.  therefore, the novel v995m mutation in the ptprt gene is particularly interesting as it may directly impact the stat3 pathway.  the mutation was found within the phosphatase domain d1 that is actively responsible for the phosphatase activity of type iib members. furthermore, ptprt was previously found to reverse tyr705 phosphorylation on stat3, a modification associated with stat3 deactivation. 12 the ptprt v995m mutation may thereby affect stat3 activity by reducing dephosphorylation of tyr705, thus increasing the expression of stat3 target genes.  this is in accordance with our results showing that patient 1 with the ptprt mutation had increased phosphorylation of stat3 and activation of stat3 responsive genes.
