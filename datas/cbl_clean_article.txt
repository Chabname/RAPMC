1|| the c-cbl loh also posity correlated with egfr and met mutations observed in the same samples.  using select c-cbl somatic mutations such as s80n/h94y, q249e and w802* (obta from caucasian, taiwanese and african-american samples, respecty) transfected in nsclc cell l, there was eased cell viability and cell motility.   conclusions  taking the overall mutation rate of c-cbl to be a combination as somatic missense mutation and loh, it is clear that c-cbl is highly mutated in lung cancers and may play an essential role in lung tumoresis and metastasis.  g the critical role of cbl in normal homeostasis and cancer, we hypothes that it might be mutated in lung cancers.  in this study, we report novel c-cbl somatic mutations s80n/h94y, q249e and w802* in caucasian, taiwanese and african-american lung cancer patients, respecty.  expressing these mutations in nsclc cell l lead to eased prolation and cell motility.  plasmid constructs and sdted mutagenesis  the wild-type c-cbl cdna insert was subcloned into the paltermax expression vector using xhoi and sali restriction enzyme s (promega, madison, wi).  using this parental plasmid paltermax-c-cbl, the tkb domain double mutation (s80n/h94y), the point mutation (q249e), and the c-terminal point mutation w802* of c-cbl were created using the following prs: 5′-gctggcgctaaagaataacccaccttatatcttagac-3′ and 5′-ctaccagatacctaccagtatctccgtactatcttgtc-3′ for the double mutation s80n/h94y;

3|| most of the changes were novel, although 4 cases had r420q as previously tified in a single case of aml. 15 apart from n454d, all residues affected by missense mutations were completely conserved in cbl orthologues as well as the 2 other human cbl family members (figure 3).  the mutation to a stop codon was found in a patient (upn 9) who also had the y371h variant; pcr across the affected regions and sequencing indicated that the 2 changes were on different alleles. in contrast, wild-type cbl conferred no growth advantage either with or without flt3 overexpression.  the n454d change was not transforming, indicating that it is probably a rare polymorphism or a pathogenetically unimportant passenger mutation (figure 7).  reproducible differences in survival between the different mutants were seen, as illustrated in figure 8a.15 we found that transforming activity correlated dtly with the ubiquitin ligase activity of the cbl variants, as assayed by their ability to transfer ha-tagged ubiquitin to flt3 after stimulation with flt3 ligand.  the s376f, h398y, p417a and r420q mutants showed loss of ubiquitin ligase activity, whereas n454d was comparable to wild-type cbl (figure 8b).   discussion  the initial aim of our study was to tify large regions of aupd and therefore we undertook a relaty low resolution genome scan using 50k snp arrays.30 although the precamino acid substitutions we tified were different from those studied, we found that mutations in both the ring finger and linker regions conferred autonomous growth to 32d/wt-flt3 cells, consistent with a causal relationship to the mpn phenotype.  the fact that one mutation (n454d) was not transforming emphas the importance of functional analysis to distinguish dr mutations from irrelevant passengers or infrequent polymorphisms. 31 notably, this mutation was only weakly conserved between species, in contrast to all other missense mutations that affected highly conserved residues and are therefore ly to be functionally significant. alternaty, heterozygosity in these cases may only be apparent due to variable proportions of background normal cells that are not part of the malignant clone.  although the nontransforming n454d mutant was heterozygous, 2 cases with heterozygous r420q were observed and thus absence of homozygosity cannot be used to infer the presence of an irrelevant, nontransforming sequence variant.   in summary, we have found that oncogenic cbl mutations are acqu in a subset of hematologically related, poor prognosis mpns.
4|| all mutations from the second group were predicted to be benign according to our computational models, whereas v430m, consistent with expertal data, had a borderldestabilizing impact on cbl-e2 binding (table 1).   finally, the third group constituted mutations (l399v, g375p, p395a and v391i) which attenuated the cbl e3 activity according to the relatdensitometry data ( 3b).  only one of these mutants was observed in two cancer samples whother three belonged to the single mutation class. concordant with this, there were intermediate levels of egfr ( 3a).  g375p and p395a mutations were predicted to have partially damaging effects whv391i and l399v were classified as benign in our predictions.  interestingly, mutations from this third group affected only some of the cbl states.

6|| salt bridges are shown as dashed l and in both cases mutation affects the stability by disrupting the salt bridge.  the second group of mutants (m374v, v430m, p428l, q249e and double mutant s80n/h94y) mainta the cbl activity equivalent to or greater than wild-type cbl (relatdensitometry of 80% or higher) ( 3b).  consistent with this, the levels of the activated egfr were also decreased in these samples ( 3a). for example, the q249e mutant showed an eased ubiquitination of egfr in 293t and hela cells whthe m374v mutant resulted in higher ubiquitination levels in a549 and hela cells (figure 3 and s6).  only v430m mutant was on the borderlwith the densitometry ratio of .  all mutations from the second group were predicted to be benign according to our computational models, whereas v430m, consistent with expertal data, had a borderldestabilizing impact on cbl-e2 binding (table 1).
7|| the oncogenic potential of tified mutants was evaluated in hematopoietic cells.  results:we tified 3 of 279 aml/mds patients expressingcbl exon 8/9 deletion mutants.  three of four cases at diagnosis expressed deleted transcripts missing exon 8 or exon 8/9. one of 116 sequenced aml/mds cases carried a r420g missense mutation.  all aml/mds patients with tified cbl mutants belonged to the core bindingfactor and 11q deletion aml subtypes.  functionally, cbl negaty regulated fmsltyroskinase 3 (flt3) activity and interacted with human flt3 via the autophosphorylation sy589 andy599 and colocal in vivo. cbl oncogenes were initially tified in the mursystem.  cbl-70z, carrying an internal deletion of 17 amino acids, was isolated from the 70z/ 3 mouse pre-b-cell lymphoma cell l(4).  cbl-70z deregulates the cellular tyroskinase machy, as nih3t3 serumstarved cells expressing cbl-70z showed significantly eased endothelial growth factor receptor (egfr) kinase activity after egf stimulation (5). © 2009 american association for cancer in the ring finger domain (8, 9) and was shown to inhibit fms-ltyroskinase 3 (flt3) internalization and ubiquitylation (7).  additional screenings of aml patients revealed more cases with cbl mutations, uding internal deletions of exon 8 and point mutations targeting g375 (10, 11).  activating flt3 mutations represent one of the most common genetic alterations in aml and are associated with a poor prognosis (12). cbl is part of the human flt3 downstream signaling pathway and promoted down-regulation of flt3 activity.  finally, cbl deletion mutants cbldexon8 and cbl exon8/9 transformed ba/f3 cells in the presence, but not in the absence of flt3-wt.  materials and methods analysis of cell l and patient samples. translational relevance in this article we provdeta insight into the role of oncogenic cbl exon8/9 mutations in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (aml)/myelodysplastic syndrome (mds), but we could not find cbl mutations in our acute lymphoblastic leukemia cohort.  analysis of a large cohort of aml/mds patients of different cytogenetic subgroups revealed an overall low frequency of cbl exon 8+9 deletions of %.  however, we tified preferential association of cbl exon8/9 mutations with core bindingfactor leukemias and 11q aberrations.  we descrthat all known human cbl deletion mutants lead to transformation of wild-type flt3 ^ expressing hematopoietic cells.  this phenotype resembles that seen with activated receptor tyroskinases. recent reports have indicated a putatcontribution of cbl mutations to the pathogenesis of human leukemias (7, 10).  to obtain a comprehensinsight into the role of cbl in human acute leukemias, we firstly did a pcr screening of the cdna of 61aml and 21acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all) cell l (table 1; supplementary table s1) for deletions in the linker and ring finger domains.  we tified a monoallelic cbl deletion transcript in the aml cell lmolm-13 and the sister cell lmolm-14. among 279 aml samples of different cytogenetic subtypes and 21t-cell all samples we detected three aml/mds patients expressing cblwt as well as an aberrant cbl transcript (table 1b).  patient 1 with a t(8;21) (aml1/eto posit and patient 2 with an 11q deletion both expressed a cbl transcript lacking exon 8, and patient 3 with an inv(16) (cbfb/myh11 posit expressed cbl lacking exon 8 and 9 (table 1b;  1a).  by pcr fragment analysis we determ the relatexpression of mutant versus cbl-wt. aberrant cbl transcripts could not be detected in any of the analyzed all cell l and all patient samples.  a murcbl deletion transcript has been descr in the 70z/3 b-cell lymphoma cell l(cbl-70z lacking the first 17 amino acids of exon 8; ref.  4). in the 70z/3 lthe causatevent is a splsmutation, changing the splacceptor sag to cg, generating an alternatspls which excludes the first 17 amino acids of exon 8 ( 1a).  analysis of the genomic dna of molm-13 cells detected a deletion of 14 nucleot at the exon 8/intron 8 boundary eliminating a table 1.  a. by amplifying a 8,050-bp fragment of genomic dna spanning intron 6 to exon 11 and subsequent nucleotsequencing, we detected mutations in all three patients expressing aberrant cbl transcripts (data not shown).  one allele of patient 1(cbldexon8) harbored a deletion of 43 nucleot at the exon 8-intron 8 boundary, uding the last 36 nucleot of exon 8 and the first 7 nucleot of intron 8, thereby losing the whole spldonor sof intron 8.  analysis of the genomic dna of patient 2 (cbldexon8) revealed a point mutation of the spldonor sof intron 8, changing the conserved ‘‘gt’’ to ‘‘gc’’ in about 10% of the amplified dna. the sample from patient 2 conta only 20% blasts, suggesting that this mutation occurred in one of the cbl alleles of the malignant clone.  patient 3 (cbldexon8+9) carries a monoallelic large genomic deletion of 1,680 nucleot, starting in intron 7 and ending in intron 9 leading to the loss of exon 8 and 9.  in conclusion, all cbl transcripts, which lack whole exons, can be expla by genomic events that target spldonor or acceptor s by mutations or deletions. tkb, tyroskinase binding domain; pr, prolrich domain.  shown below are the cbl deletion mutants, cbldexon8 and cbldexon8+9, found in aml patients, cbl-70z, a known oncogenic form of cbl, comprisinga deletion of the first 17 amino acids within exon 8, and the location of r420, found to be mutated in one aml patient in our study.  red squares, mutated region within the cbl protein. b, gel electrophoresis of cdna pcr products amplified with prs spanning the sequences encodingthe linker and ring finger domains of cbl-wt.  patient samples at diagnosis and each two remission controls of patient 1and patient 3 were analyzed for deletions.  molm-13 cells served as a positcontrol. however, coexpression of cbl-70z, cbldexon8 or cbldexon8+9 with flt3-wt led to significant il-3 independent prolation ( 3a).  compared with the cbl deletion mutants, expression of cbl r420g, r420q, g375s, and g375p point mutants did not confer any prolatcapacity, but enhanced cell survival, as 50% of cells surv for 3 days after il-3 withdrawal compared with 10% survival of the control cells (data not shown).  the presence of flt3 ligand induced a strong dosedependent prolation of flt3-wt/cbl-70z, flt3-wt/ cbldexon8, and flt3-wt/cbldexon8+9 cotransduced cells  2. collecty, the overexpression of cbl-70z, cbldexon8 or cbldexon8+9 in flt3-wt –expressing ba/f3 cells led to factor independent growth and flt3 ligand– dependent hyperprolation.  coexpression of cbl deletion mutants with flt3-wt autoactivates the flt3 receptor.  the known classes of flt3 mutations have been shown to autoactivate the kinase activity of flt3 (16, 27– 30).  we prepared lysates of flt3 ligand – stimulated and nonstimulated ba/f3 cells coexpressing flt3- wt and a cbl deletion mutant, immunoprecipitated the flt3 receptor, and analyzed it for tyrosphosphorylation.  in contrast to flt3-wt- or flt3-wt/cbl-wt –expressing cells, all three cbl mutant–expressing cells displayed autophosphorylated flt3 in the absence of flt3 ligand ( 4a). stimulation with flt3 ligand induced high phosphorylation levels of flt3  3.  cbl deletion mutants induce a transformingpotential in flt3-wt ^ expressingba/f3 cells and respond to flt3 ptk inhibitor treatment a, cells stably transduced with flt3-wtalone or flt3-wtand cbl-wt, cbl-70z, cbldexon8 or cbldexon8+9 were cultured in the absence of il3 for 72 h and viable cells counted after trypan blue exclusion.  b, cells were analyzed accordingto a, but different concentrations of fl up to 100 ng/ml were added to the culture medium. the amount of phosphorylated flt3 in flt3-wt/cbl mutant–expressing cells was consably higher than in control cells, as was the amount of total flt3 protein.  this confirms the hypothesis that coexpression of a cbl deletion mutant, but not cbl-wt, leads to a remarkable stabilization of the flt3 protein within the cells by inhibiting the down-regulation and degradation of the flt3 protein.  analysis of the phosphorylation status of transduced cbl in flt3-wt/cbl mutant –expressing cells revealed that all cbl mutants became phosphorylated after stimulation of the cells with flt3 ligand ( 4b). activated stat5 and akt were detected in unstimulated flt3-wt/cbl-70z-,  4.  coexpression of cbl deletion mutants autoactivates flt3, cbl mutants, and the downstream signaling pathways stat5 and akta, mock, flt3-wt, flt3-wt/cbl-wt, flt3-wt/cbl-70z, flt3-wt/cbldexon8, and flt3-wt/ cbldexon8+9 cells were starved for 24 h in the presence of % fcs and unstimulated or stimulated with 100 ng/ml flt3 ligand for 5 min.  flt3 was immunoprecipitated with polyclonal flt3 antibody and analyzed by immunoblottingwith phospho-tyrosantibody, stripped, and reprobed with flt3 antibody. © 2009 american association for cancer normal hematopoietic tissues did not show aberrant cbl transcripts, further pointing to an oncogenic event in the malignant clone.  indeed, all three patients carried genomic lesions affecting spldonor or acceptor s by mutation or deletion, so that we can clearly exclude aberrant splicing events within the malignant clone.  of note, we detected a preferential association of cbl mutations with specific subtypes of aml/mds. as core binding factor leukemias show a high expression of the rtk kit (40), further studies need to address the question of whether cbl mutations might lead to autoactivation of kit in these patients.  two of 13 patients with 11q deletions were found posit[% (%, %)].  this aml/mds subgroup shows the highest flt3 expression among all aml subgroups (41), so that cbl mutations might be the event causing the high flt3 expression and an aberrant flt3 activation in these patients. we analyzed all human cbl mutations thus far detected and cbl- 70z as a control.  only cells coexpressing flt3-wt and a cbl deletion mutant were able to prolate in the absence of il-3.  cbl point mutants coexpressed with flt3wt showed enhanced survival, but no prolatcapacity in baf3 cells. this discrepancy may arfrom the different cell systems used and highlights the need to analyze the phenotype of cbl mutations in primary cells.  the addition of exogenous flt3 ligand induced a rapid prolatresponse to flt3-wt cbl deletion mutant – coexpressing cells.  as aml blasts coexpress flt3 ligand leading to an autocrstimulation, this phenotype mimics the in vivo situation (47, 48). consistent with a dominant negatbehavior of cbl mutants is the fact that we detected higher levels of flt3 protein in flt3/cbl mutant cells compared with control cells, as the eased stability of the flt3 protein should be the result of a decreased degradation of flt3.  analyzing the internalization rate of flt3 in flt3-wt and flt3-wt/cbl-70z cells revealed no difference in rate and speed of internalization; thus, early steps of endocytosis of flt3 seem not to be affected by the presence of a cbl deletion mutant.  this is in concert with a study from jiang , in which late stages of endocytosis, but not recruitment of egfr into coated pits, were affected by cbl-70z (48). taken together, aberrant cbl transcripts occur in aml and are associated with core binding factor leukemias and 11q aberrations.  the cbl deletion mutants show a transforming phenotype in baf3 cells in the presence of flt3, that resembles the phenotype seen in flt3-activating mutations (flt3-itd, flt3-tkd, flt3-jm-pm).  this new mechanism of activation through mutated negatregulatory molecules of rtks opens a door for treating patients with ptk inhibitors, who do not carry mutations in the rtk itself.  methods  we applied high-density snp-a karyotyping to tify loss of heterozygosity of 11q in 442 patients with mds, mds/mpn, mpn, saml evolved from these conditions, and primary aml.  we sequenced c-cbl, cbl-b, and cbl-c in patients with or without corresponding upd or deletions and correlated mutational status with clinical features and outcomes.   results  we tified c-cbl mutations in 5% and 9% of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (cmml) and saml, and also in cml blast crisis and juvenmyelomonocytic leukemia (jmml). in myelodysplastic syndromes (mds), myelodysplastic/myeloprolatneoplasms (mds/mpn), and aml evolved from mds or mds/mpn (secondary aml [saml]), unbalanced chromosomal lesions predominate and loss of heterozygosity (loh) is of particular importance.  loh can areither via hemizygous deletion, where a dna segment is lost from one homolog whthe other remains at one copy per cell, or by uniparental disomy (upd), wherein the reta homolog is duplicated to preserve two total copies per cell at the locus.  thus, analysis of recurrent regions of loh may point toward the presence of important mutations. tp53 constitutes an example of a proapoptotic tumor suppressor gene mutated in aggressleukemias. 5–7  until recently, metaphase cytogenetics was applied for detection of chromosomal defects uding deletions resulting in loh.  using this technique, a number of invariant chromosomal abnormalities have been descr and minimal affected regions delted, pointing towards potentially pathogenic genes. among a total of 133 regions of somatic upd on multiple chromosomes uding 1, 4, 17, and 21, upd11q was most common (n = 17).  loh can also result from deletions, and deletions involving 11q were found in 29 patients (fig 1c).  sequencing c-cbl revealed mutations in 13 cases (76%) of upd11q.  however, among patients with deletion11q, a c-cbl mutation was found in only one case (cmml).  we also analyzed patients without loh11q to assess the frequency of heterozygous mutations and tified fcases (%). in one case of a patient with mds (refractory anemia subtype) and monosomy 7 who transformed to aml, snp-a karyotyping revealed the upd11q, yet after transformation to aml sequencing tified a c-cbl mutation creating a novel splsresulting in a longer transcript (appendix fig a1, onlonly).  we also found a hemizygous mutation in the linker sequence in a cmml patient with a microdeletion of 11q previously undetected by metaphase cytogenetics (appendix fig a2, onlonly).  eleven mutations were found in cmml and similar forms of mds/mpn unclassifiable either at or before the tof testing; 6 of these patients progressed to saml (55%).  an external fthat holds a picture, illustration, et object name is

in intron 9, whereas this mutation is not detected in cd3+ lymphocytes. we also uded cbl exon 12 in this extended analysis because we observed a a678v change in one sample from the initial series.   cbl exon 8 deletions  some of the mutations descr for cbl are large deletions involving exon 8 (ring finger domain)18,21–23,29,30,32,37,42 and the design of our mutation screening assay was not able to detect some of them.  we, therefore, designed a new pcr assay with prs located in exon 7 and intron 9 (e7fw: 5’-tcctgatggac-gaaatcaga-3’; e9-rv: 5’-ctcacaatggattttgccagt-3’) which would amplify a

the prolrich and uba carboxy-terminal domains (t402hfsx29) (figure 1). none of the 200 control samples analyzed showed any of these changes.  cbl exon 8 deletions were not observed in any case.   we

8|| many of these mutations are in the linker region and the ring finger of cbl, leading to a loss of e3 ligase activity.  we investigated the mechanism by which cbl-y371h, a linker region mutant, and cbl-c384r, a ring finger mutant, lead to enhanced gm-csf signaling.  expression of cbl mutants in the tf-1 cell lresulted in enhanced survival in the absence of gm-csf. this suggested enhanced kinase activity downstream of gm-csfr.  jak2 and lyn kinase expression is elevated in cbl-y371h and cbl-c384r mutant cells, resulting in enhanced phosphorylation of cbl and s6 in response to gm-csf stimulation.  bation with the jak2 inhibitor, tg101348, abolished the eased phosphorylation of gm-csfr βc in cells expressing cbl mutants, whereas treatment with the src kinase inhibitor dasatinib resulted in equalization of gm-csfr βc phosphorylation signal between wild type cbl and cbl mutant samples.  dasatinib treatment inhib the elevated phosphorylation of cbl-y371h and cbl-c384r mutants.  our study indicates that cbl linker and ring finger mutants lead to enhanced gm-csf signaling due to elevated kinase expression, which can be blocked using small molecule inhibitors targeting specific downstream pathways.  the objectof this study is to investigate how jmml-associated cbl mutations modulate gm-csf signaling and lead to gm-csf hypersensitivity.  we expressed wild type cbl, cbl-y371h, and cbl-c384r in the human tf-1 hematopoietic cell l which expresses the endogenous gm-csf receptor at physiological levels (38).  upon gm-csf stimulation, elevated phosphorylation of gm-csf βc was observed, resulting from elevated jak2 and lyn phosphorylation.  go to: expertal procedures constructs pmscv-ha-cbl retroviral vectors were used to create jmml-associated cbl mutants.  ha-tagged cbl-y371h and cbl-c384r were constructed using quikchange xl sdted mutagenesis kits (stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol.   retrovirus production hek 293t cells were plated onto 10-cm dishes (sarstedt) and grown to around 75% confluence.  the 293t cells were transiently transfected with psv (gag and pol proteins) and pvsv-g (envelope protein) and pmscv-gfp retroviral vectors expressing ha-wild type cbl, ha-cbl-y371h, or ha-cbl-c384r using lipofectam2000 (invitrogen) as dted in the manufacturer's protocol.  briefly,  μg of psv,  μg of vsv-g, and  μg of pmscv--gfp-ha-cbl constructs were m with lipofectam2000 in serum- and antibiotic-free dmem h-21 for 20 min at room temperature.  cell l and culture tf-1 cells were mainta in rpmi 1640 medium, 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 units of penicillin/ml, 100 μg of streptomycin/ml, and 2 ng/ml recombinant human gm-csf.  in order to stably express wild type and mutant cbl, tf-1 cells were infected with vsv-g pseudotyped retrovirus carrying wild type cbl, cbl-y371h, and cbl-c384r constructs.  tf-1 cells were suspended in retroviral supernatant supplemented with 8 ng/ml polybrene and centrifuged in 50-ml tubes at 12,000 rpm for 75 min. tf-1 cells endogenously express the gm-csf receptor α (gm-csfrα) and the il-3/il-5/gm-csf receptor β common chain (gm-csfr βc), and are responsto gm-csf.  ha-tagged wild type cbl, cbl-y371h, and cbl-c384r mutants were stably expressed in tf-1 cells ( 1a).  all exogenous constructs showed high expression of cbl when compared with vector-infected cells ( 1a). enhanced phosphorylation of gm-csf receptor βc upon expression of cbl mutants.  a, lysates from parental tf-1 cells as well as from tf-1 cells expressing wild type cbl, cbl-y371h, and cbl-c384r were probed for cbl expression.  ib, immunoblot. b .  binding of gm-csf to the gm-csf receptor complex activates jak2, leading to the tyrosphosphorylation of gm-csfr β in order to investigate the effects of cbl-y371h and cbl-c384r mutants on gm-csf signaling, we exam the phosphorylation of the gm-csfr βc after stimulation.  tf-1 cells expressing wild type cbl, cbl-y371h, and cbl-c384r were cytokdepleted and stimulated with gm-csf. gm-csfr βc was immunoprecipitated from lysates and immunoblotted with the 4g10 anti-phosphotyrosantibody.  upon gm-csf stimulation, cells expressing cbl-y371h and cbl-c384r mutants ( 1b, lanes 5 and 6 and lanes 8 and 9) show enhanced phosphorylation of gm-csfr βc compared with the wild type cbl controls (lanes 2 and 3).  furthermore, prolonged phosphorylation of gm-csfr βc was observed in cbl mutant samples.  cbl plays an important role in stimulation-induced endocytosis, trafficking, and degradation of numerous tyroskinase (29, 32) and cytokreceptors (41, 42).  to determwhether expression of cbl-y371h and cbl-c384r mutants has an effect on the expression of the gm-csfr βc, as well as its gm-csf induced degradation, lysates collected from gm-csf-stimulated tf-1 cells were probed for gm-csfr β because it is ly that cbl-y371h (23, 30) and cbl-c384r (43) mutations result in a loss of cbl e3 ligase activity, gm-csfr βc levels were expected to be higher in mutant cbl-expressing cells.  surprisingly, expression of cbl-y371h and cbl-c384r ( 2a, lanes 4–9) results in a decrease in gm-csfr βc compared with wild type cbl (lanes 1–3)-expressing cells at 0, 10, and 60 min ( 2b). however, it is important to note that gm-csfr βc expression decreased after gm-csf stimulation in wild type and mutant cbl-expressing cells at comparable rates.  these results indicate that although expression of cbl-y371h and cbl-c384r results in an overall decreased expression of gm-csfr βc, the degradation of the receptor poststimulation appears not to be disrupted.   figure 2. blots were reprobed for .  elevated levels of jak2 kinase in cbl-y371h- and cbl-c384r-expressing tf-1 cells upon binding of gm-csf to gm-csfrα, a gm-csfr βc homod is recru (6), bringing the βc-associated jak2 kinase (44, 45) into close proximity, allowing transphosphorylation and subsequent activation of the kinase.  activation of jak2 is essential for downstream gm-csf signaling (46, 47). the enhanced and prolonged phosphorylation of gm-csfr βc, along with a decrease in the overall expression of the receptor in cbl mutant-expressing cells may be indicatof elevated kinase activity downstream of gm-csfr β because jak2 is the main tyroskinase downstream of gm-csfr, the gm-csf-induced activation of jak2 was assessed.  tf-1 cells expressing cbl-y371h and cbl-c384r displayed elevated levels of phosphorylated jak2 upon gm-csf stimulation ( 3a, top, lanes 5 and 6 and lanes 8 and 9), compared with the wild type cbl controls (lanes 2 and 3).  reprobing for total jak2, revealed that the observed enhancement of the phospho-jak2 signal may be due to an ease in the expression of jak2 in cbl mutant-expressing cells ( 3, a (middle, lanes 4–9) and b). figure 3.  expression of cbl-y371h and cbl-c384r mutants results in elevated jak2.  a, lysates collected from tf-1 cells expressing wild type and cbl mutants were probed for phospho-tyr-1007/1008 jak2 and reprobed for total jak2 and tubulin. such loss of e3 ligase activity has been shown to result in a significant decrease in the epo-induced ubiquitination of jak2 (23).  in order to determwhether the ease in total jak2 in cbl mutant expressing cell l was due to comprom ubiquitination and degradation of the kinase, tf-1 cells expressing wild type cbl, cbl-y371h, and cbl-c384r were treated with proteasomal (mg-132) and lysosomal (chloroqu inhibitors prior to stimulation.  inhibition of proteasomal and lysosomal degradation stabil jak2 to comparable levels in all three cell l ( 3c, middle).  these results indicate that the expression of cbl-y371h and cbl-c384r mutants affects the degradation of jak2, leading to elevated levels, which in turn contribute to eased jak2 phosphorylation and potentially signaling in response to gm-csf stimulation.   eased expression of lyn kinase in cbl mutant cells although jak2 is the primary kinase activated downstream of gm-csf receptor, members of the src family kinase are stimulated in response to gm-csf (48–50). lyn also associates with gm-csfrα and is involved in the survival signal requ for factor-independent growth of cells expressing the fiδ gm-csfr βc mutant (48).  consing that tf-1 cells expressing cbl-y371h and cbl-c384r show enhanced survival whexhibiting lower expression of gm-csfr βc, we wanted to determwhether lyn phosphorylation and/or expression was altered in cbl mutant-expressing cells.  lysates collected from gm-csf-stimulated cells were probed with an antibody specific for py396-lyn, residing in a phosphorylated motif within the lyn activation loo eased lyn phosphorylation was observed in cells expressing cbl-y371h and cbl-c384r mutants ( 4a, top, lanes 4–9), compared with those expressing wild type cbl (lanes 1–3). figure 4.  eased expression of lyn kinase in cbl-y371h and cbl-c384r mutant tf-1 cells.  a, whole cell lysates collected from tf-1 cells expressing cbl-wt and cbl mutants were immunoblotted with antibodies specific for tyr(p)-396-lyn.  expression of cbl mutants results in constituts6 phosphorylation and enhanced factor-free survival investigation of signaling effectors further downstream of the gm-csf receptor revealed enhanced phosphorylation of shp2 in cbl mutant-expressing cells relatto wild type cbl controls ( 5a).  constitutphosphorylation of s6 in tf-1 cells expressing cbl-y371h and cbl-c384r, compared with wild type cbl-expressing controls ( 5b), was also observed.  no significant differences were observed in the phosphorylation of stat5 or erk1/2 ( 5c) between wild type cbl- and mutant cbl-expressing tf-1 cells after gm-csf stimulation. expression of cbl mutants results in constitutphosphorylation of s6 and enhanced survival of tf-1 cells.  a, shp2 immunoprecipitations (ip) were performed on lysates collected from tf-1 cells expressing cbl-wt, cbl-y371h, and cbl-c384r, which were .  xtt assays were performed to determwhether the expression of the cbl linker and ring finger mutants results in enhanced survival and growth.  tf-1 cells expressing cbl-y371h and cbl-c384r mutants displayed enhanced survival in the absence of gm-csf relatto cells expressing wild type cbl ( 5d).  the ease in the survival of the mutant-expressing cells decreases with easing concentration of gm-csf. to determwhether the ease in survival was due to a decrease in apoptosis, annexin v staining was performed on cytokdepr wild type and mutant cbl-expressing cells.  there was a decrease in annexin v-posittf-1 cells expressing cbl-y371h relatto wild type cbl-expressing controls, whereas the proportion of annexin v-positcbl-c384r-expressing cells was comparable with wild type cbl controls ( 5e).  these results indicate that jmml-associated cbl mutations result in enhanced survival of tf-1 cells at low doses of gm-csf. linker region mutations of cbl have been shown to lead to enhanced tyrosphosphorylation of cbl in ba/f3-flt3 cells (24).   we were interested in determining whether expression of the linker region y371h and the ring finger c384r mutations would result in altered cbl tyrosphosphorylation.  cbl was immunoprecipitated from wild type and mutant cbl tf-1 lysates, and phosphorylation was assessed by tyr(p) immunoblotting ( 6).  cbl-y371h (lanes 4–6) and cbl-c384r (lanes 7–9) were highly phosphorylated compared with cbl wild type controls (lanes 1–3).  both cbl mutants showed constitutphosphorylation in the absence of gm-csf stimulation (lanes 4 and 7). figure 6.  dasatinib treatment abolishes the enhanced phosphorylation of cbl-y371h and cbl-c384r.  tf-1 cells expressing wt and mutant cbl were bated with dasatinib and tg101348 for 2 and 4 h, respecty, prior to gm-csf stimulation. to determwhether inhibition of jak2 or src family kinases could abolish the enhanced and constitutphosphorylation of cbl, tf-1 cells expressing wild type and mutant cbl were treated with either the jak2-specific inhibitor tg101348 or the src family kinase inhibitor dasatinib prior to stimulation.  the constitutand enhanced phosphorylation of cbl-y371h and cbl-c384r mutants (lanes 22–27) persisted in tg101348-treated samples ( 6), whereas pretreatment with dasatinib abolished the elevated phosphorylation of cbl mutants (lanes 13–18) to levels comparable with wild type cbl controls (lanes 10–12).  these results indicate that downstream of the gm-csf receptor, cbl is phosphorylated by a src family kinase, potentially lyn, and mutations in the linker region or the ring finger domain of cbl lead to not only enhanced but also constitutphosphorylation of cbl. inhibition of jak2 activity via treatment with tg101348 abolishes the enhanced phosphorylation of gm-csfr β in cbl mutant-expressing cells.  tf-1 cells expressing wt-cbl, cbl-y371h, and cbl-c384r were cytokdepleted and treated with 2 mm tg101348 .  interestingly, inhibition of src family kinases did not result in the inhibition of gm-csfr βc phosphorylation, but it did result in an equivalent level of gm-csfr βc phosphorylation in wild type cbl and cbl mutant samples ( 7, lanes 19–27). in order to address these questions, we util the tf-1 hematopoietic cell l which is gm-csf-respons(38) and has a low endogenous cbl expression.  to examthe functional consequences of cbl linker region mutations, we expressed cbl-y371h linker and cbl-c384r ring finger mutants, because these are two of the most common cbl mutations observed in jmml patients (21, 22).   we found that expression of these cbl mutants in gm-csf-stimulated tf-1 cells leads to enhanced and prolonged phosphorylation of gm-csfr βc, which occurred concurrently with elevated expression of both jak2 and lyn. assessment of downstream signaling revealed enhanced phosphorylation of s6 in cbl-y371h- and cbl-c384r-expressing cells relatto wild type cbl controls.  tf-1 cells expressing cbl mutations showed enhanced survival in the absence of gm-csf, and specifically in the case of cbl-y371h-expressing cells, this is probably due to a decrease in induction of apoptosis.  we also observed elevated and constitutphosphorylation of cbl-y371h and cbl-c384r mutants, which was inhib upon treatment with dasatinib, an src family kinase inhibitor. however, inhibition of jak2 activity by tg101348 resulted in complete inhibition of gm-csfr βc phosphorylation in cbl mutant and wild type cbl control cells.   expression of cbl-y371h and cbl-c384r mutants results in prolonged and elevated receptor tyrosphosphorylation, which supports the observed enhancement in survival (67).  mart-moczygemba and huston (37, 68), using the il-5 receptor as a model for βc subunit-sharing cytokreceptors (il-3/il-5/gm-csf), demonstrated that eased βc subunit ubiquitination is observed after stimulation. they also found that the ubiquitination of the βc subunit may be mediated by cbl, because the e3 ligase was co-immunoprecipitated with the βc subunit.  the loss of e3 ligase activity of cbl-y371h and cbl-c384r mutants may prevent gm-csfr βc ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the cytoplasmic region of the receptor and culminate in the observed enhancement of gm-csfr βc phosphorylation and elevated levels of jak2.  however, this is unly, because we have observed total levels of gm-csfr βc to be lower in cbl mutant cells. the ubiquitination of βc in response to il-5 stimulation is dependent on jak2 activity (68, 69).  in cbl-y371h- and cbl-c384r-expressing cells, the enhanced jak2 activity can potentially lead to eased ubiquitination of the βc by other ubiquitin ligases, resulting in decreased overall expression of the receptor subunit.   jak2 is also regulated via cbl-mediated ubiquitination (23, 70).  the expression of cbl mutants y371h and c384r may result in decreased ubiquitination of jak2, culminating in elevated levels of jak2 as well as enhanced jak2-mediated phosphorylation of gm-csfr β we found that in cbl mutant cells, there was elevated expression of jak2 kinase, which was abolished upon treatment with proteasomal and lysosomal inhibitors.   similar to jak2, several members of the src family kinases (71), uding lyn, have been shown to be ubiquitinated (72) by cbl (73, 74).  the enhanced expression of lyn in tf-1 cells expressing cbl-y371h and cbl-c384r indicates that, downstream of gm-csfr, cbl is responsible for lyn ubiquitination.  lyn mediates the tyrosphosphorylation of cbl downstream of β1 integrin (61), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (g-csf) (62, 75), and the b-cell ant receptor (63, 76).  we have observed enhanced tyrosphosphorylation of cbl-y371h and cbl-c384r mutants, which is abolished upon treatment with the src family kinase inhibitor dasatinib.  this confirms that lyn is a kinase responsible for tyrosphosphorylation of cbl downstream of the gm-csfr, and the enhanced phosphorylation of cbl mutants may be a functional consequence of the elevated levels of lyn in cbl mutant-expressing cells. these data suggest that cbl linker and ring finger mutants lower the threshold concentration of gm-csf requ to induce cell survival.  together, these results suggest that in cbl-y371h- and cbl-c384r-expressing cells, the modulation of the pi3-k pathway due to the ease in lyn levels may be contributing to the observed enhancement of survival in the absence of gm-csf.   the mechanism by which these mutations lead to elevated gm-csf signaling and enhanced survival depends on the role of cbl as both an e3 ligase and an adaptor protein.  cbl-y371h and cbl-c384r mutants compromthe e3 ligase activity of cbl.  we have shown that these loss-of-function mutations lead to eased levels of jak2 and lyn kinases downstream of the gm-csfr, potentially due to loss of ubiquitination of the kinases or to the inhibition of gm-csfr βc ubiquitination and cytoplasmic domain degradation. although these studies are useful to probe how cbl mutations perturb flt3 signaling in aml, no studies have exam the role of cbl jmml mutations in gm-csf-dependent signaling pathways to date.  our analysis reveals that expression of cbl-y371h or cbl-c384r in tf-1 cells generates gm-csf hypersensitivity that affects proximal steps in receptor activation, uding gm-csfr βc, jak2, and lyn coupling to pi3k activation.  unlwith the ba/f3 results, we fa to observe effects on erk1/2 or stat5 activation. we classified all mutations into three groups (damaging, attenuating and benign) according to their expertal relatdensitometry data and compared expertal data with the estimates produced by the computational models.  the first group of damaging mutants uded c396r, h398q, y371h, k382e and c381a which completely abolished cbl activity (relatdensitometry was less than 10%) ( 3b) and the levels of total egfr were not decreased by these mutants ( 3a).  only two of these mutants belonged to the recurrent class of mutations. k382e mutation was previously observed in noonan syndrome and was speculated to affect cbl stability or binding (40).  finally, the y371h mutation not only abolished phosphorylation at the y371 sbut also had a profound destabilizing effect on all four states as evt from table 1.   figure 4 figure 4 structures of wild type (green) and k382e mutant (tan) are shown for ncbl and pcbl-e2-s states. consistent with this, the fold ease in egf stimulated ubiquitination of the egfr by wild-type cbl was smaller in hela cells (about three fold) compared to either a549 or hek293t cells (more than 10 fold in each).  as in hek293t cells, the y371h mutant did not stimulate ubiquitination compared to the vector transfected control for a549 or hela cells ( s6a and c).  the cbl mutants that were fully actin hek293t cells ( 3a and b) mainta cbl e3 activity in a549 and hela cells ( s6).
9|| many of these mutations are in the linker region and the ring finger of cbl, leading to a loss of e3 ligase activity.  we investigated the mechanism by which cbl-y371h, a linker region mutant, and cbl-c384r, a ring finger mutant, lead to enhanced gm-csf signaling.  expression of cbl mutants in the tf-1 cell lresulted in enhanced survival in the absence of gm-csf. this suggested enhanced kinase activity downstream of gm-csfr.  jak2 and lyn kinase expression is elevated in cbl-y371h and cbl-c384r mutant cells, resulting in enhanced phosphorylation of cbl and s6 in response to gm-csf stimulation.  bation with the jak2 inhibitor, tg101348, abolished the eased phosphorylation of gm-csfr βc in cells expressing cbl mutants, whereas treatment with the src kinase inhibitor dasatinib resulted in equalization of gm-csfr βc phosphorylation signal between wild type cbl and cbl mutant samples.  dasatinib treatment inhib the elevated phosphorylation of cbl-y371h and cbl-c384r mutants.  our study indicates that cbl linker and ring finger mutants lead to enhanced gm-csf signaling due to elevated kinase expression, which can be blocked using small molecule inhibitors targeting specific downstream pathways.  the objectof this study is to investigate how jmml-associated cbl mutations modulate gm-csf signaling and lead to gm-csf hypersensitivity.  we expressed wild type cbl, cbl-y371h, and cbl-c384r in the human tf-1 hematopoietic cell l which expresses the endogenous gm-csf receptor at physiological levels (38).  upon gm-csf stimulation, elevated phosphorylation of gm-csf βc was observed, resulting from elevated jak2 and lyn phosphorylation.  go to: expertal procedures constructs pmscv-ha-cbl retroviral vectors were used to create jmml-associated cbl mutants.  ha-tagged

cytokdepleted and stimulated with gm-csf. gm-csfr βc was immunoprecipitated from lysates and immunoblotted with the 4g10 anti-phosphotyrosantibody.  upon gm-csf stimulation, cells expressing cbl-y371h and cbl-c384r mutants ( 1b, lanes 5 and 6 and lanes 8 and 9) show enhanced phosphorylation of gm-csfr βc compared with the wild type cbl controls (lanes 2 and 3).  furthermore, prolonged phosphorylation of gm-csfr βc was observed in cbl mutant samples.  cbl plays an important role in stimulation-induced endocytosis, trafficking, and degradation of numerous tyroskinase (29, 32) and cytokreceptors (41, 42).  to determwhether expression of cbl-y371h and cbl-c384r mutants has an effect on the expression of the gm-csfr βc, as well as its gm-csf induced degradation, lysates collected from gm-csf-stimulated tf-1 cells were probed for gm-csfr β because it is ly that cbl-y371h (23, 30) and cbl-c384r (43) mutations result in a loss of cbl e3 ligase activity, gm-csfr βc levels were expected to be higher in mutant cbl-expressing cells.  surprisingly, expression of cbl-y371h and cbl-c384r ( 2a, lanes 4–9) results in a decrease in gm-csfr βc compared with wild type cbl (lanes 1–3)-expressing cells at 0, 10, and 60 min ( 2b). however, it is important to note that gm-csfr βc expression decreased after gm-csf stimulation in wild type and mutant cbl-expressing cells at comparable rates.  these results indicate that although expression of cbl-y371h and cbl-c384r results in an overall decreased expression of gm-csfr βc, the degradation of the receptor poststimulation appears not to be disrupted.   figure 2. blots were reprobed for .  elevated levels of jak2 kinase in cbl-y371h- and cbl-c384r-expressing tf-1 cells upon binding of gm-csf to gm-csfrα, a gm-csfr βc homod is recru (6), bringing the βc-associated jak2 kinase (44, 45) into close proximity, allowing transphosphorylation and subsequent activation of the kinase.  activation of jak2 is essential for downstream gm-csf signaling (46, 47). the enhanced and prolonged phosphorylation of gm-csfr βc, along with a decrease in the overall expression of the receptor in cbl mutant-expressing cells may be indicatof elevated kinase activity downstream of gm-csfr β because jak2 is the main tyroskinase downstream of gm-csfr, the gm-csf-induced activation of jak2 was assessed.  tf-1 cells expressing cbl-y371h and cbl-c384r displayed elevated levels of phosphorylated jak2 upon gm-csf stimulation ( 3a, top, lanes 5 and 6 and lanes 8 and 9), compared with the wild type cbl controls (lanes 2 and 3).  reprobing for total jak2, revealed that the observed enhancement of the phospho-jak2 signal may be due to an ease in the expression of jak2 in cbl mutant-expressing cells ( 3, a (middle, lanes 4–9) and b). figure 3.  expression of cbl-y371h and cbl-c384r mutants results in elevated jak2.  a, lysates collected from tf-1 cells expressing wild type and cbl mutants were probed for phospho-tyr-1007/1008 jak2 and reprobed for total jak2 and tubulin. such loss of e3 ligase activity has been shown to result in a significant decrease in the epo-induced ubiquitination of jak2 (23).  in order to determwhether the ease in total jak2 in cbl mutant expressing cell l was due to comprom ubiquitination and degradation of the kinase, tf-1 cells expressing wild type cbl, cbl-y371h, and cbl-c384r were treated with proteasomal (mg-132) and lysosomal (chloroqu inhibitors prior to stimulation.  inhibition of proteasomal and lysosomal degradation stabil jak2 to comparable levels in all three cell l ( 3c, middle).  these results indicate that the expression of cbl-y371h and cbl-c384r mutants affects the degradation of jak2, leading to elevated levels, which in turn contribute to eased jak2 phosphorylation and potentially signaling in response to gm-csf stimulation.   eased expression of lyn kinase in cbl mutant cells although jak2 is the primary kinase activated downstream of gm-csf receptor, members of the src family kinase are stimulated in response to gm-csf (48–50). lyn also associates with gm-csfrα and is involved in the survival signal requ for factor-independent growth of cells expressing the fiδ gm-csfr βc mutant (48).  consing that tf-1 cells expressing cbl-y371h and cbl-c384r show enhanced survival whexhibiting lower expression of gm-csfr βc, we wanted to determwhether lyn phosphorylation and/or expression was altered in cbl mutant-expressing cells.  lysates collected from gm-csf-stimulated cells were probed with an antibody specific for py396-lyn, residing in a phosphorylated motif within the lyn activation loo eased lyn phosphorylation was observed in cells expressing cbl-y371h and cbl-c384r mutants ( 4a, top, lanes 4–9), compared with those expressing wild type cbl (lanes 1–3). figure 4.  eased expression of lyn kinase in cbl-y371h and cbl-c384r mutant tf-1 cells.  a, whole cell lysates collected from tf-1 cells expressing cbl-wt and cbl mutants were immunoblotted with antibodies specific for tyr(p)-396-lyn.  expression of cbl mutants results in constituts6 phosphorylation and enhanced factor-free survival investigation of signaling effectors further downstream of the gm-csf receptor revealed enhanced phosphorylation of shp2 in cbl mutant-expressing cells relatto wild type cbl controls ( 5a).  constitutphosphorylation of s6 in tf-1 cells expressing cbl-y371h and cbl-c384r, compared with wild type cbl-expressing controls ( 5b), was also observed.  no significant differences were observed in the phosphorylation of stat5 or erk1/2 ( 5c) between wild type cbl- and mutant cbl-expressing tf-1 cells after gm-csf stimulation. expression of cbl mutants results in constitutphosphorylation of s6 and enhanced survival of tf-1 cells.  a, shp2 immunoprecipitations (ip) were performed on lysates collected from tf-1 cells expressing cbl-wt, cbl-y371h, and cbl-c384r, which were .  xtt assays were performed to determwhether the expression of the cbl linker and ring finger mutants results in enhanced survival and growth.  tf-1 cells expressing cbl-y371h and cbl-c384r mutants displayed enhanced survival in the absence of gm-csf relatto cells expressing wild type cbl ( 5d).  the ease in the survival of the mutant-expressing cells decreases with easing concentration of gm-csf. to determwhether the ease in survival was due to a decrease in apoptosis, annexin v staining was performed on cytokdepr wild type and mutant cbl-expressing cells.  there was a decrease in annexin v-posittf-1 cells expressing cbl-y371h relatto wild type cbl-expressing controls, whereas the proportion of annexin v-positcbl-c384r-expressing cells was comparable with wild type cbl controls ( 5e).  these results indicate that jmml-associated cbl mutations result in enhanced survival of tf-1 cells at low doses of gm-csf. linker region mutations of cbl have been shown to lead to enhanced tyrosphosphorylation of cbl in ba/f3-flt3 cells (24).   we were interested in determining whether expression of the linker region y371h and the ring finger c384r mutations would result in altered cbl tyrosphosphorylation.  cbl was immunoprecipitated from wild type and mutant cbl tf-1 lysates, and phosphorylation was assessed by tyr(p) immunoblotting ( 6).  cbl-y371h (lanes 4–6) and cbl-c384r (lanes 7–9) were highly phosphorylated compared with cbl wild type controls (lanes 1–3).  both cbl mutants showed constitutphosphorylation in the absence of gm-csf stimulation (lanes 4 and 7). figure 6.  dasatinib treatment abolishes the enhanced phosphorylation of cbl-y371h and cbl-c384r.  tf-1 cells expressing wt and mutant cbl were bated with dasatinib and tg101348 for 2 and 4 h, respecty, prior to gm-csf stimulation. to determwhether inhibition of jak2 or src family kinases could abolish the enhanced and constitutphosphorylation of cbl, tf-1 cells expressing wild type and mutant cbl were treated with either the jak2-specific inhibitor tg101348 or the src family kinase inhibitor dasatinib prior to stimulation.  the constitutand enhanced phosphorylation of cbl-y371h and cbl-c384r mutants (lanes 22–27) persisted in tg101348-treated samples ( 6), whereas pretreatment with dasatinib abolished the elevated phosphorylation of cbl mutants (lanes 13–18) to levels comparable with wild type cbl controls (lanes 10–12).  these results indicate that downstream of the gm-csf receptor, cbl is phosphorylated by a src family kinase, potentially lyn, and mutations in the linker region or the ring finger domain of cbl lead to not only enhanced but also constitutphosphorylation of cbl. inhibition of jak2 activity via treatment with tg101348 abolishes the enhanced phosphorylation of gm-csfr β in cbl mutant-expressing cells.  tf-1 cells expressing wt-cbl, cbl-y371h, and cbl-c384r were cytokdepleted and treated with 2 mm tg101348 .  interestingly, inhibition of src family kinases did not result in the inhibition of gm-csfr βc phosphorylation, but it did result in an equivalent level of gm-csfr βc phosphorylation in wild type cbl and cbl mutant samples ( 7, lanes 19–27). in order to address these questions, we util the tf-1 hematopoietic cell l which is gm-csf-respons(38) and has a low endogenous cbl expression.  to examthe functional consequences of cbl linker region mutations, we expressed cbl-y371h linker and cbl-c384r ring finger mutants, because these are two of the most common cbl mutations observed in jmml patients (21, 22).   we found that expression of these cbl mutants in gm-csf-stimulated tf-1 cells leads to enhanced and prolonged phosphorylation of gm-csfr βc, which occurred concurrently with elevated expression of both jak2 and lyn.  assessment of downstream signaling revealed enhanced phosphorylation of s6 in cbl-y371h- and cbl-c384r-expressing cells relatto wild type cbl controls.  tf-1 cells expressing cbl mutations showed enhanced survival in the absence of gm-csf, and specifically in the case of cbl-y371h-expressing cells, this is probably due to a decrease in induction of apoptosis.  we also observed elevated and constitutphosphorylation of cbl-y371h and cbl-c384r mutants, which was inhib upon treatment with dasatinib, an src family kinase inhibitor.  interestingly, treatment with dasatinib also led to equalization of gm-csfr βc phosphorylation between wild type cbl- and cbl mutant-expressing cells. however, inhibition of jak2 activity by tg101348 resulted in complete inhibition of gm-csfr βc phosphorylation in cbl mutant and wild type cbl control cells.   expression of cbl-y371h and cbl-c384r mutants results in prolonged and elevated receptor tyrosphosphorylation, which supports the observed enhancement in survival (67).  mart-moczygemba and huston (37, 68), using the il-5 receptor as a model for βc subunit-sharing cytokreceptors (il-3/il-5/gm-csf), demonstrated that eased βc subunit ubiquitination is observed after stimulation. they also found that the ubiquitination of the βc subunit may be mediated by cbl, because the e3 ligase was co-immunoprecipitated with the βc subunit.  the loss of e3 ligase activity of cbl-y371h and cbl-c384r mutants may prevent gm-csfr βc ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the cytoplasmic region of the receptor and culminate in the observed enhancement of gm-csfr βc phosphorylation and elevated levels of jak2.  however, this is unly, because we have observed total levels of gm-csfr βc to be lower in cbl mutant cells. the ubiquitination of βc in response to il-5 stimulation is dependent on jak2 activity (68, 69).  in cbl-y371h- and cbl-c384r-expressing cells, the enhanced jak2 activity can potentially lead to eased ubiquitination of the βc by other ubiquitin ligases, resulting in decreased overall expression of the receptor subunit.   jak2 is also regulated via cbl-mediated ubiquitination (23, 70).  the expression of cbl mutants y371h and c384r may result in decreased ubiquitination of jak2, culminating in elevated levels of jak2 as well as enhanced jak2-mediated phosphorylation of gm-csfr β we found that in cbl mutant cells, there was elevated expression of jak2 kinase, which was abolished upon treatment with proteasomal and lysosomal inhibitors.   similar to jak2, several members of the src family kinases (71), uding lyn, have been shown to be ubiquitinated (72) by cbl (73, 74).  the enhanced expression of lyn in tf-1 cells expressing cbl-y371h and cbl-c384r indicates that, downstream of gm-csfr, cbl is responsible for lyn ubiquitination.  lyn mediates the tyrosphosphorylation of cbl downstream of β1 integrin (61), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (g-csf) (62, 75), and the b-cell ant receptor (63, 76).  we have observed enhanced tyrosphosphorylation of cbl-y371h and cbl-c384r mutants, which is abolished upon treatment with the src family kinase inhibitor dasatinib.  this confirms that lyn is a kinase responsible for tyrosphosphorylation of cbl downstream of the gm-csfr, and the enhanced phosphorylation of cbl mutants may be a functional consequence of the elevated levels of lyn in cbl mutant-expressing cells. these data suggest that cbl linker and ring finger mutants lower the threshold concentration of gm-csf requ to induce cell survival.  together, these results suggest that in cbl-y371h- and cbl-c384r-expressing cells, the modulation of the pi3-k pathway due to the ease in lyn levels may be contributing to the observed enhancement of survival in the absence of gm-csf.   the mechanism by which these mutations lead to elevated gm-csf signaling and enhanced survival depends on the role of cbl as both an e3 ligase and an adaptor protein.  cbl-y371h and cbl-c384r mutants compromthe e3 ligase activity of cbl.  we have shown that these loss-of-function mutations lead to eased levels of jak2 and lyn kinases downstream of the gm-csfr, potentially due to loss of ubiquitination of the kinases or to the inhibition of gm-csfr βc ubiquitination and cytoplasmic domain degradation. although these studies are useful to probe how cbl mutations perturb flt3 signaling in aml, no studies have exam the role of cbl jmml mutations in gm-csf-dependent signaling pathways to date.  our analysis reveals that expression of cbl-y371h or cbl-c384r in tf-1 cells generates gm-csf hypersensitivity that affects proximal steps in receptor activation, uding gm-csfr βc, jak2, and lyn coupling to pi3k activation.  unlwith the ba/f3 results, we fa to observe effects on erk1/2 or stat5 activation.
10|| all mutations from the second group were predicted to be benign according to our computational models, whereas v430m, consistent with expertal data, had a borderldestabilizing impact on cbl-e2 binding (table 1).   finally, the third group constituted mutations (l399v, g375p, p395a and v391i) which attenuated the cbl e3 activity according to the relatdensitometry data ( 3b).  only one of these mutants was observed in two cancer samples whother three belonged to the single mutation class. concordant with this, there were intermediate levels of egfr ( 3a).  g375p and p395a mutations were predicted to have partially damaging effects whv391i and l399v were classified as benign in our predictions.  interestingly, mutations from this third group affected only some of the cbl states.
11|| mutant cbl constructs were established by pcr-mediated mutagenesis.  purified pcr amplicons (cblwt, cblc381a, cblk382e, cbld390y, and cblr420q) were cloned into pentr/d-topo (ltechnologies, darmstadt, germany) according to the protocol prov.  constructs were sequenced for integrity and used for the transfer into gateway™-compatible destination vector pcdna3-dest, following the manufacturer's instructions. means were consed significant different at p value <.  subsequently, post hoc two-ta unpa student's t-tests were used to determstatistical significance of the difference of the mean values between two conditions each (, cblwt versus cblc381a, cblk382e, cbld390y, or cblr420q).  values are presented as the mean ± sd and were consed significant different at p value <. amino acid substitutions analyzed in this study are indicated.  b: k382e, d390y, and r420q amino acid changes compromcbl function during removal of surface egfr.  cos-7 cells transiently expressing the indicated cbl protein variants or transfected with empty vector (mock) were cultured under serum-starved conditions overnight. post hoc testing was not performed.  cbl amino acid changes k382e, d390y, and r420q alter cellular egfr distribution  if cbl mutations interfere with egfr internalization, the amount of surface and intracellular egfr should be altered in cells expressing mutant cbl proteins.  therefore, we determ the level of surface and intracellular egfr in cells stimulated with egf for 30 min by using surface biotinylation-based assays. expression of cblwt resulted in a clear reduction of surface egfr upon egf stimulation ( 1b, cblwt, precipitates, 30 min) relatto unstimulated cells ( 1b, cblwt, precipitates, 0 min).  in contrast, transfection of cells with cbl mutants ( 1b; cblk382e, cbld390y, or cblr420q) or with empty vector ( 1b, mock) did not induce marked alterations of surface egfr levels ( 1b, compare precipitates for 0 and 30 min each).  in lwith this, cblc381a, a ring finger mutant ( 1a) that has already been shown to perturb egfr internalization [waterman , 1999; thien , 2001] and that we used as an internal control, also did not stimulate removal of surface egfr ( 1b). densitometric measurements and statistical analysis revealed that only % of initial egfr (unstimulated cells) rema at the surface of cells ectopically expressing cblwt; however, cells expressing mutant cbl variants or mock-transfected cells displayed between % and % of initial egfr at the cell surface after 30-min egf treatment ( 1c).  thus, cblwt may promote egf-induced egfr internalization, whereas mutations associated with noonan syndrome-lphenotypes (k382e, d390y, and r420q) as well as the established ring finger mutation c381a may compromthis cbl effect.  even though differences of mean values did not reach statistical significance in these experts by using one-way anova (data not shown), a tendency for impa removal of surface egfr caused by cbl mutations is obvious. cblwt overexpression resulted in a marked enrichment of the intracellular egfr fraction upon 30-min egf treatment ( 2a, blots on the left-hand s precipitates, 30 min) indicating efficient ligand-induced egfr internalization.  cells expressing any of the tested cbl mutants (cblk382e, cbld390y, cblr420q, or cblc381a) showed slightly decreased levels of intracellular egfr relatto cblwt-expressing cells ( 2a, autoradiographs on the left-hand s precipitates, 30 min).  mock-transfected cells also showed reduced amounts of internal egfr compared to cblwt-expressing cells ( 2a, autoradiographs on the right-hand s precipitates; [note: all bands on these autoradiographs represent results after 30-min egf stimulation]). strong expression of cblwt resulted in eased intracellular egf488 compared to control cells on the same spec ( 3a).  in contrast, cells strongly expressing cblk382e, cbld390y, cblr420q, or cblc381a showed reduced amounts of intracellular egf488 when compared to control cells on the respectsame spec ( 3a).  we validated these observations by quantification, normalization, and statistical evaluation of immuncytochemical specs: although expression of cblwt strongly eased intracellular egf488 levels, expression of any cbl mutant decreased the amount of intracellular egf488 ( 3b).  taken together, our data demonstrate that cbl amino acid changes k382e, d390y, and r420q alter the cellular distribution of egfr and we suggest that impa egfr internalization underlies this defect.   figure 2.  figure 3.  open in figure viewerdownload powerpoint slexpression of cblc381a, cblk382e, cbld390y, or cblr420q decreases egf uptake.  a: cos-7 cells were transiently transfected with cbl expression constructs as indicated and serum starved overnight. p values were calculated by unpa two-ta student's t-test; ***p < .  cbl amino acid changes k382e, d390y, and r420q impair cbl-mediated egfr ubiquitylation and abrogate the stimulating effect of cbl on egfr degradation  the cbl ring finger domain is central to the e3 ubiquitin ligase activity [zheng , 2000], and cbl-mediated ubiquitylation strongly affects the postendocytic egfr fate by lysosomal targeting and subsequent degradation of ubiquitylated receptors [swaminathan and tsygankov, 2006; sorkin and goh, 2009].  first, we monitored the capacity of wild-type and mutant cbl proteins to ubiquitylate egfr upon 30-min egf stimulation by using precipitation-based ubiquitylation assays. overexpression of cblwt resulted in a strong ubiquitylation signal in egfr precipitates ( 4a, top panel; cblwt) relatto mock-transfected cells ( 4a, top panel; mock).  in contrast, transfection of cells with cbl mutants associated with noonan-lphenotypes did not result in augmented egfr ubiquitylation ( 4a, top panel; cblk382e, cbld390y, or cblr420q).  similarly, cells expressing ubiquitylation-deficient cblc381a [waterman , 1999; thien , 2001] showed slightly lower levels of ubiquitylated egfr than cblwt cells ( 4a, top panel; cblc381a and cblwt). perfectly in lwith the function of ubiquitin-labeling as a trigger for degradation [swaminathan and tsygankov, 2006; sorkin and goh, 2009], the total amount of egfr in cells expressing cblwt was markedly decreased ( 4a, second and third panel).  these representatdata from one out of three independent experts strongly indicate that dse-associated cbl amino acid changes k382e, d390y, and r420q abrogate cbl ubiquitin ligase activity.  to measure the impact of cbl mutations on egfr degradation, we determ the amounts of total egfr upon 60, 120, and 240 min of egf stimulation. in contrast, in cells transfected with empty vector, egfr levels slowly decreased over the t starting with a slight reduction of egfr at 60 min to a marked loss at 240 min of egf treatment ( 4b).  cells expressing cblk382e, cbld390y, or cblr420q showed very similar egfr degradation kics to that of mock-transfected cells ( 4b), which indicates loss of the stimulating effect of cbl on egfr degradation.  interestingly, it seemed that expression of cblc381a most effecty blocks egfr degradation ( 4b). we verified these observations by densitometric measurements and statistical analysis of several independent experts ( 4c): cblwt induced a reduction to % of initial egfr after 60-min egf stimulation, whereas mock transfection or expression of cblk382e, cbld390y, or cblr420q resulted in a decrease to %, %, %, and % of initial egfr, respecty ( 4c).  these data demonstrate that the promoting effect of cblwt on egfr degradation is impa by dse-associated mutations k382e, d390y, and r420q.  notably, the control mutant cblc381a strongly delayed egfr degradation with only 20% of initial egfr amounts having been degraded at 240 min upon egf treatment ( 4c).  figure 4.  open in figure viewerdownload powerpoint slc381a, k382e, d390y, and r420q impair cbl-mediated egfr ubiquitylation and degradation.  (a) egfr ubiquitylation. we documented a tcourse for erk phosphorylation upon egf stimulation and we found no statistically significant differences after 10- and 30-min egf stimulation between cells expressing cblwt and either cells expressing dse-associated cbl protein variant or mock-transfected cells ( 5a and b).  at 60 min upon egf stimulation, cells expressing cblwt showed reduced erk1/2 phosphorylation compared with mock-transfected cells; however, cells expressing cblc381a, cblk382e, cbld390y, or cblr420q did not ( 5a and b).  in fact, phospho-erk1/2 levels were significantly eased in cblc381a, cblk382e, cbld390y, or cblr420q cells relatto cblwt-expressing cells at 60 min upon egf stimulation ( 5a and b). quantification revealed between -fold and -fold higher erk phosphorylation levels in cells expressing cbl mutant proteins or in mock-transfected cells than in cblwt-expressing cells ( 5b).  we conclude that amino acid changes c381a, k382e, d390y, and r420q abrogate the potential of cbl to attenuate ras-mapk signaling.   figure 5.  figure 5.  open in figure viewerdownload powerpoint slc381a, k382e, d390y, and r420q disrupt cbl-mediated downregulation of erk phosphorylation.  a: cos-7 cells were transiently transfected with cbl expression constructs (as indicated) or with empty vector (mock) and cultured under serum-starved conditions overnight. defectendocytic sorting of receptors has been already proposed as a pathomechanistic basis for noonan syndrome related phenotypes [martli , 2010].  by deta analyses, we could now demonstrate that rasopathy-associated amino acid changes k382e, d390y, and r420q in the cbl ring domain (i) derange the cellular distribution of egfr, (ii) interfere with cbl-mediated ubiquitylation of egfr, (iii) abrogate the stimulating effect of cbl on egfr degradation, and (iv) disrupt cbl-mediated downregulation of ras-mapk signaling.   egfr is internal through different mechanisms: non-clathrin-mediated endocytosis (nce) and clathrin-mediated endocytosis (cme) [sorkin and goh, 2009]. taken together, we suggest that rasopathy-associated amino acid changes, which disrupt the ability of cbl to ubiquitylate egfr, compromegfr internalization and, therefore, result in higher amounts of surface and lower amounts of intracellular egfr ( 1b and c and 2).  notably, intracellular egfr levels in mock-transfected cells, which lie between those in wild-type and mutant cbl-expressing cells ( 2), may indicate a dominant-negateffect of cbl changes k382e, d390y, and r420q on egfr internalization.  accordingly, dominant-negateffects of myeloid neoplasm-associated cbl missense mutations (q367p, y371 s, and r420q) on cbl ubiquitin ligase function and receptor endocytosis have been demonstrated [sargin , 2007; sanada , 2009]. in lwith this, we detected rapid and efficient egfr degradation upon ectopic expression of cblwt, but not in cells expressing mutant cbl protein variants ( 4a and b).  s all tested rasopathy-associated cbl variants and mock-transfection caused very similar degradation kics, we suggest loss-of-function consequences of k382e, d390y, and r420q on egfr degradation.  interestingly, the c381a mutation strongly delayed and blocked egfr degradation. we classified all mutations into three groups (damaging, attenuating and benign) according to their expertal relatdensitometry data and compared expertal data with the estimates produced by the computational models.  the first group of damaging mutants uded c396r, h398q, y371h, k382e and c381a which completely abolished cbl activity (relatdensitometry was less than 10%) ( 3b) and the levels of total egfr were not decreased by these mutants ( 3a).  only two of these mutants belonged to the recurrent class of mutations. c396r, h398q and c381a mutations disrupted zn-coordinating clusters and had very damaging consequences according to the stability model for both ncbl and cbl-s states and damaging effects on cbl-e2 binding even though none of these mutations were located on the cbl-e2 interface.  on the other hand, the k382e mutation did not affect zn-coordination but destabil the ncbl state.  this, in turn, could be expla by the charge substitution that led to the disruption of the k382-e373 salt bridge within the closed state of ncbl (figure 4 and figure s5a).  moreover, k382e mutation had a significant impact on cbl-e2 binding due to the disruption of a salt bridge between py371 and k382 affecting the stability of cbl in the actstate (figure 4 and figure s5d).  no significant changes were observed for cbl-s and cbl-e2-s states (figure s5b,c).  k382e mutation was previously observed in noonan syndrome and was speculated to affect cbl stability or binding (40).  finally, the y371h mutation not only abolished phosphorylation at the y371 sbut also had a profound destabilizing effect on all four states as evt from table 1.   figure 4 figure 4 structures of wild type (green) and k382e mutant (tan) are shown for ncbl and pcbl-e2-s states.  salt bridges are shown as dashed l and in both cases mutation affects the stability by disrupting the salt bridge.

thien , 2001] and that we used as an internal control, also did not stimulate removal of surface egfr ( 1b). densitometric measurements and statistical analysis revealed that only % of initial egfr (unstimulated cells) rema at the surface of cells ectopically expressing cblwt; however, cells expressing mutant cbl variants or mock-transfected cells displayed between % and % of initial egfr at the cell surface after 30-min egf treatment ( 1c).  thus, cblwt may promote egf-induced egfr internalization, whereas mutations associated with noonan syndrome-lphenotypes (k382e, d390y, and r420q) as well as the established ring finger mutation c381a may compromthis cbl effect.  even though differences of mean values did not reach statistical significance in these experts by using one-way anova (data not shown), a tendency for impa removal of surface egfr caused by cbl mutations is obvious. cblwt overexpression resulted in a marked enrichment of the intracellular egfr fraction upon 30-min egf treatment ( 2a, blots on the left-hand s precipitates, 30 min) indicating efficient ligand-induced egfr internalization.  cells expressing any of the tested cbl mutants (cblk382e, cbld390y, cblr420q, or cblc381a) showed slightly decreased levels of intracellular egfr relatto cblwt-expressing cells ( 2a, autoradiographs on the left-hand s precipitates, 30 min).  mock-transfected cells also showed reduced amounts of internal egfr compared to cblwt-expressing cells ( 2a, autoradiographs on the right-hand s precipitates; [note: all bands on these autoradiographs represent results after 30-min egf stimulation]). strong expression of cblwt resulted in eased intracellular egf488 compared to control cells on the same spec ( 3a).  in contrast, cells strongly expressing cblk382e, cbld390y, cblr420q, or cblc381a showed reduced amounts of intracellular egf488 when compared to control cells on the respectsame spec ( 3a).  we validated these observations by quantification, normalization, and statistical evaluation of immuncytochemical specs: although expression of cblwt strongly eased intracellular egf488 levels, expression of any cbl mutant decreased the amount of intracellular egf488 ( 3b).  taken together, our data demonstrate that cbl amino acid changes k382e, d390y, and r420q alter the cellular distribution of egfr and we suggest that impa egfr internalization underlies this defect.   figure 2.  figure 3.  open in figure viewerdownload powerpoint slexpression of cblc381a, cblk382e, cbld390y, or cblr420q decreases egf uptake.  a: cos-7 cells were transiently transfected with cbl expression constructs as indicated and serum starved overnight. p values were calculated by unpa two-ta student's t-test; ***p < .  cbl amino acid changes k382e, d390y, and r420q impair cbl-mediated egfr ubiquitylation and abrogate the stimulating effect of cbl on egfr degradation  the cbl ring finger domain is central to the e3 ubiquitin ligase activity [zheng , 2000], and cbl-mediated ubiquitylation strongly affects the postendocytic egfr fate by lysosomal targeting and subsequent degradation of ubiquitylated receptors [swaminathan and tsygankov, 2006; sorkin and goh, 2009].  first, we monitored the capacity of wild-type and mutant cbl proteins to ubiquitylate egfr upon 30-min egf stimulation by using precipitation-based ubiquitylation assays. overexpression of cblwt resulted in a strong ubiquitylation signal in egfr precipitates ( 4a, top panel; cblwt) relatto mock-transfected cells ( 4a, top panel; mock).  in contrast, transfection of cells with cbl mutants associated with noonan-lphenotypes did not result in augmented egfr ubiquitylation ( 4a, top panel; cblk382e, cbld390y, or cblr420q).  similarly, cells expressing ubiquitylation-deficient cblc381a [waterman , 1999; thien , 2001] showed slightly lower levels of ubiquitylated egfr than cblwt cells ( 4a, top panel; cblc381a and cblwt). perfectly in lwith the function of ubiquitin-labeling as a trigger for degradation [swaminathan and tsygankov, 2006; sorkin and goh, 2009], the total amount of egfr in cells expressing cblwt was markedly decreased ( 4a, second and third panel).  these representatdata from one out of three independent experts strongly indicate that dse-associated cbl amino acid changes k382e, d390y, and r420q abrogate cbl ubiquitin ligase activity.  to measure the impact of cbl mutations on egfr degradation, we determ the amounts of total egfr upon 60, 120, and 240 min of egf stimulation. in contrast, in cells transfected with empty vector, egfr levels slowly decreased over the t starting with a slight reduction of egfr at 60 min to a marked loss at 240 min of egf treatment ( 4b).  cells expressing cblk382e, cbld390y, or cblr420q showed very similar egfr degradation kics to that of mock-transfected cells ( 4b), which indicates loss of the stimulating effect of cbl on egfr degradation.  interestingly, it seemed that expression of cblc381a most effecty blocks egfr degradation ( 4b). we verified these observations by densitometric measurements and statistical analysis of several independent experts ( 4c): cblwt induced a reduction to % of initial egfr after 60-min egf stimulation, whereas mock transfection or expression of cblk382e, cbld390y, or cblr420q resulted in a decrease to %, %, %, and % of initial egfr, respecty ( 4c).  these data demonstrate that the promoting effect of cblwt on egfr degradation is impa by dse-associated mutations k382e, d390y, and r420q.  notably, the control mutant cblc381a strongly delayed egfr degradation with only 20% of initial egfr amounts having been degraded at 240 min upon egf treatment ( 4c).  figure 4.  open in figure viewerdownload powerpoint slc381a, k382e, d390y, and r420q impair cbl-mediated egfr ubiquitylation and degradation.  (a) egfr ubiquitylation. we documented a tcourse for erk phosphorylation upon egf stimulation and we found no statistically significant differences after 10- and 30-min egf stimulation between cells expressing cblwt and either cells expressing dse-associated cbl protein variant or mock-transfected cells ( 5a and b).  at 60 min upon egf stimulation, cells expressing cblwt showed reduced erk1/2 phosphorylation compared with mock-transfected cells; however, cells expressing cblc381a, cblk382e, cbld390y, or cblr420q did not ( 5a and b).  in fact, phospho-erk1/2 levels were significantly eased in cblc381a, cblk382e, cbld390y, or cblr420q cells relatto cblwt-expressing cells at 60 min upon egf stimulation ( 5a and b). quantification revealed between -fold and -fold higher erk phosphorylation levels in cells expressing cbl mutant proteins or in mock-transfected cells than in cblwt-expressing cells ( 5b).  we conclude that amino acid changes c381a, k382e, d390y, and r420q abrogate the potential of cbl to attenuate ras-mapk signaling.   figure 5.  figure 5.  open in figure viewerdownload powerpoint slc381a, k382e, d390y, and r420q disrupt cbl-mediated downregulation of erk phosphorylation.  a: cos-7 cells were transiently transfected with cbl expression constructs (as indicated) or with empty vector (mock) and cultured under serum-starved conditions overnight. defectendocytic sorting of receptors has been already proposed as a pathomechanistic basis for noonan syndrome related phenotypes [martli , 2010].  by deta analyses, we could now demonstrate that rasopathy-associated amino acid changes k382e, d390y, and r420q in the cbl ring domain (i) derange the cellular distribution of egfr, (ii) interfere with cbl-mediated ubiquitylation of egfr, (iii) abrogate the stimulating effect of cbl on egfr degradation, and (iv) disrupt cbl-mediated downregulation of ras-mapk signaling.   egfr is internal through different mechanisms: non-clathrin-mediated endocytosis (nce) and clathrin-mediated endocytosis (cme) [sorkin and goh, 2009]. egfr ubiquitylation seems to be indispensable for nce [sigismund , 2013], whereas the need of egfr ubiquitylation for cme is discussed controversially [madshus and stang, 2009; sorkin and goh, 2009; haglund and dikic, 2012; sigismund , 2012].  in lwith our data on cbl-mediated egfr ubiquitylation ( 4a), recently it has been reported that the dse-associated cbl amino acid changes d390y and r420q result in impa egfr ubiquitylation in response to egf stimulation [martli , 2010]; this indicates loss-of-function consequences regarding the cbl ubiquitin ligase capacity.  several reports have shown that an intact cbl linker-ring domain is essential for egf/egfr internalization [e. taken together, we suggest that rasopathy-associated amino acid changes, which disrupt the ability of cbl to ubiquitylate egfr, compromegfr internalization and, therefore, result in higher amounts of surface and lower amounts of intracellular egfr ( 1b and c and 2).  notably, intracellular egfr levels in mock-transfected cells, which lie between those in wild-type and mutant cbl-expressing cells ( 2), may indicate a dominant-negateffect of cbl changes k382e, d390y, and r420q on egfr internalization.  accordingly, dominant-negateffects of myeloid neoplasm-associated cbl missense mutations (q367p, y371 s, and r420q) on cbl ubiquitin ligase function and receptor endocytosis have been demonstrated [sargin , 2007; sanada , 2009]. in lwith this, we detected rapid and efficient egfr degradation upon ectopic expression of cblwt, but not in cells expressing mutant cbl protein variants ( 4a and b).  s all tested rasopathy-associated cbl variants and mock-transfection caused very similar degradation kics, we suggest loss-of-function consequences of k382e, d390y, and r420q on egfr degradation.  interestingly, the c381a mutation strongly delayed and blocked egfr degradation. overexpression of a dominant-negatform of c-cbl (cbl-70z) inhib fl-induced flt3 ubiquitylation and internalization, indicating involvement of c-cbl in flt3 signaling.  dna sequencing of aml bone marrow revealed a case with a c-cbl point mutation (cbl-r420q).  cblr420qinhib flt3internalization and ubiquitylation.  coexpression of cbl-r420q or cbl- 70z with flt3 induced cytokindependent growth and survival of 32dcl3 cells in the absence of fl.  also, the mutant cbl proteins altered the amplitude and duration of flt3- dependent signaling events. generation of stable cell l the generation of 32d cells stably expressing wild-type flt3 or flt3-itd has been previously descr. 23,24 for generating cbl-overexpressing 32d cell l, parental 32d or 32d cells stably expressing flt3 receptors were electroporated with different cbl constructs (c-cbl-wt, cbl-70z, cblr420q), as descr. 23 the stable cbl-expressing bulk cultures were selected using neomycin (800  g/ml). sdted mutagenesis sdted mutagenesis was performed using the quickchange sted mutagenesis kit (stratagene, amsterdam, the netherlands) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.  to construct cbl-r420q, the point mutation was introduced in the c-cbl cdna.  for generating kinasedeficient flt3 (flt3-k644a), lys644 of flt3-wt was replaced with alan both mutations were confirmed by sequencing. quickly placing cells on and adding cold pbs containing % sodium az after washing, the cells were bated with a pe-labeled anti-ha antibody for 30 minutes at 4° the mean fluorescence intensity of the sta cells was analyzed by flow cytometry using cellquest software (bd biosciences, palo alto, ca).  for ligand-binding assays of the egfr and pdgfr, cho cells were transfected with egfr or pdgfr and c-cbl-wt, cbl-r420q, or cbl-70z or with gfp as a control.  after 48 hours, cells were serum depr for 6 hours and receptor internalization was induced with 50 ng/ml egf/pdgf for the indicated t.’’ ha-tagged flt3 was then immunoprecipitated, extensy washed with lysis buffer, and washed 3 t with ubiquitylation buffer (ub) containing 50 mm tris-hcl (ph ),  mm mg2cl, and 1 mm dtt.  immunoprecipitated ha-flt3 (10  g) was diluted in ub buffer with 25  m his-ub, 100 nm e1 enzyme (boston biochem, cambridge, ma), 500 nm e2 enzyme (boston biochem), 4 mm atp, 2  g of either purified gst-cbl-ring, gst-cbl-70z-ring, or gst-cbl-r420q-ring, in a final volume of 25  l.  the reaction mixture was bated at 30°c for 4 hours and then analyzed by sds-page followed by western blotting.15,30 therefore, we analyzed the coding sequences of the corresponding exons in c-cbl and cbl-b from the blasts of 150 aml patients by dt cdna and genomic dna sequencing.  the cdna and genomic dna of c-cbl from one aml patient with a normal karyotype and no flt3 mutation conta a g to a substitution at position 1259 of the published human c-cbl sequence that results in the substitution of the charged arginresidue at position 420 with glutam(r420q) (figure 4a).  the presence of the mutation was independently verified in the cdna and the genomic dna in both dtions, using different pcr products and different sequencing prs. argin420 is evolutionary highly conserved and has been suggested to be involved in the contact sof cbl with the e2 ubiquitin-conjugation enzyme ubch we cloned this c-cbl mutant (cbl-r420q) into an expression vector and analyzed its association with flt3 and the consequences of its presence for flt3 ubiquitylation and internalization.  as shown in figure 4b, cblr420q associates with flt3-wt.  flt3 was readily ubiquitylated after ligand activation in the presence of wild-type c-cbl, but not in the presence of cbl-r420q (figure 4b-c).  in vitro ubiquitylation assays revealed that in contrast to the wild-type ring domain, the ring domain containing the r420q mutation was unable to function as an e3 ubiquitin ligase for flt3 (figure 4d).  rtk signal mitigation has been shown to be dependent on cbl-mediated receptor internalization and ubiquitylation.5,7,31,32 therefore, we analyzed the consequences of cbl-r420q overexpression for rtk internalization.  interestingly, cbl-r420q strongly inhib ligand-induced internalization of egfr and pdgfr, a process dependent on intact cbl function (figure 4e).  furthermore, cbl-r420q inhib flt3 internalization to a similar extent as cbl-70z. in conclusion, we have tified a cbl mutation in primary blasts from an aml patient that effecty inhibits ubiquitylation and internalization of rtks upon overexpression.  cbl-r420q has transforming capacity in the presence of flt3 we next analyzed the biologic significance of the aml-associated cbl mutation (cbl-r420q) in myeloid cells.  similar to cbl-70z, cbl-r420q mutant induced prolation and survival of 32d cells (figure 5a-c) and induced long-term, cytokindependent prolation of the cultures exclusy in the presence of flt3. the effects of su11248 on the biologic effects of concomitant cbl-70z and flt3 expression (figure 3d) indicated that the flt3 kinase activity was necessary for the observed synergistic biologic effects.  to exclude the possibility that off-target effects of chemical kinase inhibitors might be responsible for growth inhibition of the cells, we coexpressed a kinase-inactflt3 mutant with cbl-r420q in 32d cells.  as expected from the inhibitor experts, kinase-dead flt3 (flt3-k644a) fa to induce autonomous growth of 32d cells, even in the presence of cbl-r420q (figure 5a-c). coexpression of wild-type cbl with flt3 receptors led to diminished activation of akt and erk signaling.  in contrast, coexpression of cbl-70z (figure 5d) or cbl-r420q (figure 5e and data not shown) induced a stronger activation of the akt and erk pathways as indicated by phosphorylation of the respectsignaling intermediates after 10 minutes.  in tcourse experts, we observed a signifi- cantly prolonged activation of erk activity up to 60 minutes after fl stimulation in cells coexpressing cbl-70z or cbl-r420q (figure 5e).  in summary, our data show that the newly tified aml-associated cbl mutation r420q disturbs flt3 signal mitigation comparable with cbl-70z, and laffects 32d cell growth in an flt3 kinase–dependent manner.  discussion in human cancers, deregulated activation of receptor tyroskinases is a frequent event. also, we confirm previous results that tyrosphosphorylation of c-cbl is enhanced by flt3 activation. 25 sequencing analysis of cbl in blasts from a cohort of aml patients revealed a single case of a somatic mutation in the ring domain of c-cbl (cbl-r420q).  analysis of the amino acid substitution and comparison of the resulting mutant protein with the published structure of the c-cbl ubiquitin ligase domain suggests that this mutant residue is critically involved in the binding of c-cbl with the e2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme ubc-h7 and suggests that a mutation at this position may inhibit the e3 ligase activity of c-cbl. 31 indeed, we present biochemical evce that the r420q mutation strongly inhibits the ubiquitin ligase activity of c-cbl, the essential function of c-cbl requ for rtk signaling mitigation.  our data also provevce that cbl-mediated regulation of flt3 is biologically important.  coexpression of cbl-70z or cbl-r420q with flt3 readily transformed 32d cells, even in the absence of flt3 ligand.  it has been previously reported that dominant-negatcbl mutants enhance the survival of myeloid cells. however, as in our report, they alone did not support cellular prolation. 40 here, we observed a strong synergism between cbl-70z or cbl-r420q and flt3 receptors in myeloid transformation.  its exact molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated. however, our data obta with a flt3-specific inhibitor (figure 3d) and the kinase-inactflt3 receptor (figure 5a) suggest that flt3 kinase activity is requ for the observed synergism.  it appears ly that cbl-70z and cbl-r420q cause a low but constitutactivation of the flt3 receptor.  s cbl proteins have been shown to also associate with c-kit and influence c-kit activity,6,41,42 it may well be that the observed synergism relates not only to flt3, but also to other hematopoietic type iii rtks. taken together, these data show that cbl proteins are dtly involved in flt3 signal control and suggest that interference with the function of negatregulators of rtk signaling may play a role in aml transformation.  to our knowledge, the novel cbl-r420q mutation tified here is the first reported cbl mutation with obvious transforming ability in human dse.  although we tified this mutation in a single patient, it is possible that alterations in the negatregulatory machy of rtks are more frequently involved in leukemogenic signal transduction. first, cbl proteins consist of a family of several members with presumably redundant function.  dominant-negatmutations in any cbl family member may induce similar effects as observed for cbl-r420q.  also, termination of rtk signaling is a complex multistep process, which requ several sorting, segregation, and degradation steps, each of which involve many different proteins.39 the potent effects of figure 4.  cbl-r420q inhibits ubiquitylation and endocytosis of rtks.  (a) tification of a novel cbl mutant from an aml patient.” c-cbl of one patient showed a heterozygous mutation at position 1259 (g a), resulting in replacement of argin420 by glutamof c-cbl.  (b,c) cbl-r420q binds to flt3 and inhibits ubiquitylation of flt3.  cos-7 cells were transiently transfected with the indicated plasmids together with a plasmid for ha-tagged ubiquitin. the immunoprecipitates were resolved on sds-page and analyzed with anti-ha or anti-cbl (panel b) or anti-flt3 (panel c) antibodies.  (d) the r420q mutation results in loss of cbl e3 ubiquitin ligase activity.  the 293t cells were transiently transfected with flt3 and flt3 was immunoprecipitated.5,38 presence of the ptb domain and simultaneous interference with the e3 ligase function of c-cbl have been def to be essential minimal requents for cblmediated transformation, presumably through dominant-negatinterference with the normal cbl function.  our biochemical analyses here show that cbl-r420q fulfils these requents.  however, it is not quclear, whether cbl-mediated transformation is solely due to dominant-negateffects of oncogenic cbl proteins, or whether the mutations also prova gain of function.5,15 furthermore, the phosphotyross in the c-terminus are highly phosphorylated in cbl-70z, suggesting that this region of cbl may play an important role in oncogenic properties at least of cbl-70z.  interestingly, the novel cbl-r420q mutation fulfils all the requents of potent cbl oncogenes, s it consists only of a point mutation in the e3 ligase domain of c-cbl, maintaining all other protein domains that are potentially involved in posity mediating oncogenic rtk signaling.  importantly, cbl mutant–mediated transformation depended on the presence of flt3 and can be blocked by flt3 kinase inhibitors.  g the near-unsal importance of the cbl-associated machy in rtk signal mitigation, it is very ly that mutations in the involved proteins (such as cbl r420q) are influenced in their transforming activity by different rtks.  thus, our data provan important example for the critical involvement of tyroskinases in a transformation mechanism, where the primary genetic defect is local in the negatregulatory machy. copy number at 11q was estimated by multiplex ligation probe amplification (mlpa) using the marfan probeset 1 (p065; mrc holland, amsterdam, the netherlands), a kit that contains four 11q control probes uding one at 11q.   constructs  pmy-wtcbl and pmy-cblr420q express wild-type and r420q cbl, respecty, along with green fluorescent protein (gfp). 15 other cbl mutant constructs were der from pmy-wtcbl using the quikchange sdted mutagenesis kit (stratagene, la jolla, ca).  view inliew popup table 2 cases analyzed for cbl mutations view inliew popup table 3 list of cbl sequence variants of the 27 cbl variants, 21 (78%) were missense substitutions affecting 12 amino acids (15 different substitutions), 5 (19%) were candidate splicing abnormalities, and 1 (3%) produced a stop codon (table 3).  most of the changes were novel, although 4 cases had r420q as previously tified in a single case of aml. 15 apart from n454d, all residues affected by missense mutations were completely conserved in cbl orthologues as well as the 2 other human cbl family members (figure 3). a third case (upn 15) originally presented with v617f jak2 negatet in 1989 but progressed to mf in 2004.  analysis of dna extracted from sequential bone marrow sl indicated that the r420q mutation was absent at the et phase but acqu on transformation (figure 4b).  the 3 cbl-positmf cases tested negatfor mpl 515 mutations and all cbl mutation positcases were negatfor cytogenetic indicators of tyroskinase fusions, flt3 itd, activating nras mutations and v617f jak2, with the exception of 1 case (upn 14) with mf who tested positfor both l380p cbl and v617f jak2. (b) sequential leukocyte and platelet counts for case, who presented in 1989 with essential thrombocythemia (et) but progressed to myelofibrosis (mf) in 2004.  homozygous cbl r420q, indicated by *, was detected on transformation but was undetectable in previous specs.  (c) clinical course of case upn 14, who presented with mf in 1998 but experienced elevated leukocyte counts in 2005, concomitant with the appearance of the cbl l380p mutation. the differences between mutation positand negatcases was not significant as determ by kaplan-meier analysis.  transforming activities of cbl mutants  we determ whether selected cbl variants had oncogenic activity by testing whether they could transform the interleukin-3 (il-3)–dependent cell l32d to growth factor independence in conjunction with overexpression of wild-type flt3, as has been descr previously for r420q. 15 we found that s376f, h398y, p417a, and r420q alone each conferred a degree of growth factor independence to 32d cells, but this effect was consably enhanced in 32ds that overexpressed wild-type flt3. total blots for flt3 and cbl are also shown.  abrogation of e3 ubiquitin ligase activity  it has been shown that flt3 physically associates with cbl and that, upon ligand stimulation, flt3 is rapidly ubiquitinylated by wild-type but not r420q cbl. 15 we found that transforming activity correlated dtly with the ubiquitin ligase activity of the cbl variants, as assayed by their ability to transfer ha-tagged ubiquitin to flt3 after stimulation with flt3 ligand.  the s376f, h398y, p417a and r420q mutants showed loss of ubiquitin ligase activity, whereas n454d was comparable to wild-type cbl (figure 8b).   discussion  the initial aim of our study was to tify large regions of aupd and therefore we undertook a relaty low resolution genome scan using 50k snp arrays. alternaty, heterozygosity in these cases may only be apparent due to variable proportions of background normal cells that are not part of the malignant clone.  although the nontransforming n454d mutant was heterozygous, 2 cases with heterozygous r420q were observed and thus absence of homozygosity cannot be used to infer the presence of an irrelevant, nontransforming sequence variant.   in summary, we have found that oncogenic cbl mutations are acqu in a subset of hematologically related, poor prognosis mpns. the proto-oncogene c-cbl negaty regulates kit and flt3 by its e3 ligase activity and acts as a scaffold.  we recently tified the first c-cbl mutation in human dse in an acute myeloid leukemia patient, called cbl-r420q.  here we analyzed the role of cbl mutants on kit-mediated transformation.  coexpression of cbl-r420q or cbl-70z with kit induced cytokindependent prolation, survival, and clonogenic growth.  primary murbone marrow retrovirally transduced with c-cbl mutants and transplanted into mled to a

deletion mutant (at the boundary of the linker and ring finger domain) isolated from 70z/3 mouse pre–b-cell lymphoma. 17 we recently tified the first c-cbl oncogenic mutation in human dse in an acute myeloid leukemia (aml) patient, called cbl-r420q, and analyzed the role of this cbl mutant in flt3 signaling. 19 cbl-r420q and cbl-70z were able to confer interleukin-3 (il-3)–independent growth to the 32dcl3 cell lin the presence of wild-type flt3 receptor. the role of cbl in kit signaling in the context of leukemia is not well understood.  here, we found that mutant cbl proteins, cbl-r420q and cbl-70z, displayed in vitro transforming activity for myeloid cells that was dependent on the presence of kit.  these cbl mutants altered internalization, ubiquitination, and downstream signaling of the kit receptor. cells were selected with 15  g/ml blasticidin (invitrogen) in il-3–supplemented culture.  later these cells were infected with retroviral supernatants of pmy cbl-r420q, pmy cbl-70z,

counted on day 6.  results cbl mutants (cbl-r420q and cbl-70z) confer ligand-independent growth in cooperation with kit recently, we published the role of 2 dominant-negatcbl mutants, cbl-r420q and cbl-70z, in flt3 signaling. 19 because early hematopoietic stem cells and leukemic progenitor cells express high levels of the kit receptor tyroskinase, we were interested to analyze whether dominant-negatcbl proteins would synergwith this receptor. however, in the absence of cbl mutants, cells coexpressing kit-wt alone prolated only in the presence of scf (data not shown).  prolation was more pronounced in the cells coexpressing cbl-70z and kit-wt compared with cells coexpressing cbl-r420q and kit-wt.  cultures expressing one of the cbl mutants with kit-wt surv for extended tperiods in the absence of any growth factors (figure 1b). coexpression of cbl mutants with kit-wt induced a pronounced prolatgrowth advantage in the absence of scf, and this growth was further enhanced after scf stimulation (figure 1c).  neither cbl-r420q– nor kit-wt– expressing cells led to scf-independent growth.  cells expressing cbl-70z alone showed a moderate growth advantage,42 which was only for a short duration (figure 1a-b). cbl mutants synergwith kit to induce autonomous growth and in vitro colony formation.  (a-b) cbl-70z and cbl-r420q induce ligand-independent prolation and survival of 32d-kit-wt cells.  the 32d cells stably overexpressing kit-wt and/or indicated cbl mutants were starved from il-3, and cells were grown in the presence of 10% fcs. in contrast, expression of cbl mutants together with kit induced the growth of numerous large and dispersed colonies (figure 1e).  cbl mutants induce a general mastocytosis and a myeloprolatdse in a murbone marrow transplantation model to investigate the transforming capability of different cbl mutants in vivo, we generated murecotropic retrovirus (pmy) expressing cbl-r420q, cbl-70z, or empty vector.  we used a bicistronic retroviral vector coexpressing the cbl mutants together with the egfp via an internal ribosomal entry s40 bone marrow was transduced with each retrovirus at a t of 4  105 retroviral particles per millil and analyzed by flow cytometry for egfp expression, and the total cell number was determ. a total of 150 000 egfp cells was injected into the tail vein of lethally irradiated (8 gy) female balb/c recipient m initial control experts showed a similar level of expression between cblr420q and cbl-70z (data not shown).  almost all recipients of bone marrow cells transduced with cbl mutants developed a lethal hematologic disorder with a mean latency of 341 days in the cbl-r420q group and 395 days in the cbl-70z group (figure 2a,c).  eleven of 13 min the cbl-r420q group and 8 of 11 min the cbl-70z group died.  two animals in the cbl-r420q group died of a “myeloid leukemia with maturation,” matching all 5 cria for nonlymphoid leukemia of the bethesda proposals. 43 these 2 mshowed leukocytosis of up to 140 000/ l (supplemental figure 1b, available on the blood webs see the supplemental materials link at the top of the onlarticle) with more than 20% blasts in the peripheral blood (supplemental figure1a) and up to 70% blast infiltration in the spleen (figure 3). histology sections of spleen, l, and bone marrow and facs analyses of spleen, bone marrow, and peripheral blood showed extensinfiltration of blasts and mature myeloid cells (figures 2e, 3; supplemental figure 1d).  importantly, all the animals in the cbl-r420q and cbl-70z group showed a diffuse organ infiltration (spleen, l, bone marrow, lung, kidney, heart) of mast cells with a very variable range of mast cell infiltration (figure 3; supplemental figure 2a).  six mshowed massmast cell infiltration, reminiscent of mast cell sarcoma. expression of cbl mutants led to a lethal mastocytosis and myeloprolatdse in a murbone marrow transplantation model.

(b) splenomegaly in mthat rece transplantations of cbl mutant-transduced bone marrow cells; empty vector (control). cos-7 cells were transiently transfected with kit-wt and hatagged ubq in the presence or absence of cbl mutants to study the ubiquitination.  kit was effecty ubiquitinated in the presence of endogenous cbl after stimulation with scf (figure 4b), but the presence of cbl-r420q completely abolished ubiquitination of the activated receptor.  cbl-70z also repressed ubiquitination, but not to the same extent as cbl-r420q. histopathology of the bone marrow (bm), l, and spleen from mtransplanted with cbl mutant-transduced bone marrow cells.  spleen, l, and bone marrow sections (hematoxylin and eosin [he], giemsa, nace; original magnifications, 100-1000) from a representatleukemic mouse (cbl-r420q) and a mouse with mast cell sarcoma (cbl-70z), which rece bone marrow cells transduced with cbl-r420q or cbl-70z, respecty.  normal organ archture is visible in a control mouse.  the leukemic mouse (cblr420q) reveals a massinfiltration of immature myeloid cells with its maximum in the spleen and consecutdestruction of the normal organ structure.  there are also mast cells sporadically visible in between the immature cell infiltration (arrow in the spleen pictures and giemsa staining). cbl mutants alter signal quality after ligand stimulation of kit we then analyzed the effects of cbl mutants on the quality, amplitude, and duration of kit signaling (figure 4d-h).  coexpression of cbl-70z or cbl-r420q with kit receptors induced a stronger activation of the akt and erk pathways as indicated by phosphorylation of the respectsignaling intermediates after 10 minutes (figure 4e).  furthermore, akt and, to a lesser extent, erk were phosphorylated (ie, activated) even in the absence of growth factors (figure 4e). no activation of intracellular signaling mediators was observed when the cbl mutants were overexpressed alone (figure 4d).  in tcourse experts, we observed a prolonged activation of kit, akt, and erk activity up to 240 minutes after scf stimulation in cells expressing cbl-70z or cbl-r420q (figure 4f-h).  in addition, cbl-70z expression led to autophosphorylation of the kit receptor in the absence of any ligand (figure 4f). kinase activity of kit and flt3 is dispensable for cbl-70z–mediated transformation to elucidate the mechanism of transformation by cbl mutants and kit receptor, we generated 32d cells stably expressing kd mutants of kit (kit-d790n, kit-kd) in the presence or absence of cbl mutants.  analyzing the prolatcapacity of cells that coexpressed kit-kd and cbl-r420q, we surprisingly found a subtle growth and survival advantage compared with kit-kd alone (figure 5a-b).  this effect was more pronounced with cbl-70z. (a) kit physically interacts with c-cbl.  32d-kit-wt cells stably transfected with ha-tagged cbl proteins (cbl-wt, cbl-r420q, and cbl-70z) were depr from cytok overnight and subsequently exposed to the indicated cytok for 10 minutes.  cbl proteins were immunoprecipitated by anti-ha antibodies, and immunoprecipitates were resolved on sds-page. to find out the signaling molecules supporting this transforming effect of cbl-70z, we exam akt, erk, and stat pathways in 32d cell l coexpressing kit-kd or flt3-kd and cbl mutants.  surprisingly, we found ligand-independent activation of akt only in the cells overexpressing cbl-70z in the presence of either of the kd receptors, but not in the cells overexpressing cbl-r420q or in the control cells (figure 6b; supplemental figure 3d).  there were no differences in erk or stat5 activation (figure 6b). interestingly, we did not observe basic levels of ubiquitination of the receptor, compared with the basic level of the unstimulated kit-wt receptor (figure 6c).  taken together, cbl- 70z and cbl-r420q not only strongly synerg with unstimulated receptor tyroskinases with intact kinase function, but surprisingly also induce biologically meaningful signaling events emanating from kinase-inactclass iii receptor tyroskinases.  sfks are necessary for cbl-70z–mediated transformation sfks play an important role in intracellular signaling processes, for example, of cytokreceptors, which do not have tyroskinase activity.19 as shown here, the expression of kit in myeloid 32d cells does not lead to cytokndependent growth.  however, in the presence of cbl-r420q or cbl-70z, kit expression promotes cytokindependent growth (figure 1a).  this effect can be enhanced after scf stimulation.  similarly, coexpression of kit with either cbl-r420q or cbl-70z promotes survival (figure 1b) and prolation (figure 1c).  in addition, coexpression of kit and either of the cbl mutants led to colony growth in the absence of growth factors (figure 1d-e). (b) cbl-70z binds stronger to p-sfks and cbl mutants physically interact with the kd kit receptor.  the 32d cells with or without kit-kd stably transfected with ha-tagged cbl proteins (cbl-r420q and cbl-70z) were treated as in panel a.  cbl proteins were immunoprecipitated by anti-ha antibodies, and immunoprecipitates were resolved on sds-page. as the cbl mutants affect the stability of several intracellular and surface molecules, uding flt3 and kit in these in vivo experts, we were unable to pinpoint the contribution of the cbl targets to the dse phenotype.  although unproven, the similarity of cbl-70z and cbl-r420q in dse development suggests a similar mechanism for both mutants.  a recent report showed that hematopoietic stem cells from cbl /  mhave an eased pool s are hyperprolat and show enhanced long-term repopulating capacity.57 to our knowledge, the in vivo data presented in figures 2 and 3 are the first in vivo evce that a cbl mutant tified from human malignancy is involved in dse pathogenesis.  the minor differences observed between cbl-r420q and cbl-70z are within the variability of animal expertation that we and others have observed.  it is well established that an intact ring domain is requ for the e3 ligase activity of cbl. 58,59 cbl-70z and cbl-r420q have a disrupted ring domain and are e3 ligase defect19 cbl-r420q and cbl-70z therefore prevent ubiquitination and endocytosis of kit (figure 4b-c).  we were interested to further clarify the mechanisms of transformation by cbl mutants and performed a careful analysis of the signaling properties conferred by kit in the presence or absence of cbl mutants. coimmunoprecipitation experts showed that cbl mutants are part of a complex with kit after ligand stimulation (figure 4a).  importantly, cbl-70z (and to a lesser extent cbl-r420q) coimmunoprecipitated with kit in the absence of ligand.  this suggests a constitutcomplex formation between cbl mutants and kit (figure 4a), which was similarly observed for egfr60 and flt our data reveal functional differences between cbl-70z and cbl-r420q.  the loss of e3 ligase activity is more pronounced in cells expressing cbl-r420q than in those expressing cbl-70z (figure 4b), whereas the consequences of expression of either cbl mutant appear to be very similar in both the in vitro and in vivo experts with primary murbone marrow (figures 2-3).  however, the biologic consequences of cbl-70z are more dramatic in cell culture experts performed in 32d cells (figures 1, 5-6).38,64 therefore, up-regulation of sfk activity in the presence of cbl mutants could be expla by inhibition of their degradation (figure 7a).  in addition, we found cbl-r420q and cbl-70z in complex with kit-kd and sfks (figure 7b).  inhibition of sfks led also to akt inhibition (figure 7e), suggesting that sfks act upstream of pi3k/akt pathway as previously reported.
13|| mutant cbl constructs were established by pcr-mediated mutagenesis.  purified pcr amplicons (cblwt, cblc381a, cblk382e, cbld390y, and cblr420q) were cloned into pentr/d-topo (ltechnologies, darmstadt, germany) according to the protocol prov.  constructs were sequenced for integrity and used for the transfer into gateway™-compatible destination vector pcdna3-dest, following the manufacturer's instructions. means were consed significant different at p value <.  subsequently, post hoc two-ta unpa student's t-tests were used to determstatistical significance of the difference of the mean values between two conditions each (, cblwt versus cblc381a, cblk382e, cbld390y, or cblr420q).  values are presented as the mean ± sd and were consed significant different at p value <. in contrast, transfection of cells with cbl mutants ( 1b; cblk382e, cbld390y, or cblr420q) or with empty vector ( 1b, mock) did not induce marked alterations of surface egfr levels ( 1b, compare precipitates for 0 and 30 min each).  in lwith this, cblc381a, a ring finger mutant ( 1a) that has already been shown to perturb egfr internalization [waterman , 1999; thien , 2001] and that we used as an internal control, also did not stimulate removal of surface egfr ( 1b).  densitometric measurements and statistical analysis revealed that only % of initial egfr (unstimulated cells) rema at the surface of cells ectopically expressing cblwt; however, cells expressing mutant cbl variants or mock-transfected cells displayed between % and % of initial egfr at the cell surface after 30-min egf treatment ( 1c).  thus, cblwt may promote egf-induced egfr internalization, whereas mutations associated with noonan syndrome-lphenotypes (k382e, d390y, and r420q) as well as the established ring finger mutation c381a may compromthis cbl effect.  even though differences of mean values did not reach statistical significance in these experts by using one-way anova (data not shown), a tendency for impa removal of surface egfr caused by cbl mutations is obvious. cblwt overexpression resulted in a marked enrichment of the intracellular egfr fraction upon 30-min egf treatment ( 2a, blots on the left-hand s precipitates, 30 min) indicating efficient ligand-induced egfr internalization.  cells expressing any of the tested cbl mutants (cblk382e, cbld390y, cblr420q, or cblc381a) showed slightly decreased levels of intracellular egfr relatto cblwt-expressing cells ( 2a, autoradiographs on the left-hand s precipitates, 30 min).  mock-transfected cells also showed reduced amounts of internal egfr compared to cblwt-expressing cells ( 2a, autoradiographs on the right-hand s precipitates; [note: all bands on these autoradiographs represent results after 30-min egf stimulation]). strong expression of cblwt resulted in eased intracellular egf488 compared to control cells on the same spec ( 3a).  in contrast, cells strongly expressing cblk382e, cbld390y, cblr420q, or cblc381a showed reduced amounts of intracellular egf488 when compared to control cells on the respectsame spec ( 3a).  we validated these observations by quantification, normalization, and statistical evaluation of immuncytochemical specs: although expression of cblwt strongly eased intracellular egf488 levels, expression of any cbl mutant decreased the amount of intracellular egf488 ( 3b).  figure 3.  open in figure viewerdownload powerpoint slexpression of cblc381a, cblk382e, cbld390y, or cblr420q decreases egf uptake.  a: cos-7 cells were transiently transfected with cbl expression constructs as indicated and serum starved overnight. in contrast, transfection of cells with cbl mutants associated with noonan-lphenotypes did not result in augmented egfr ubiquitylation ( 4a, top panel; cblk382e, cbld390y, or cblr420q).  similarly, cells expressing ubiquitylation-deficient cblc381a [waterman , 1999; thien , 2001] showed slightly lower levels of ubiquitylated egfr than cblwt cells ( 4a, top panel; cblc381a and cblwt).  perfectly in lwith the function of ubiquitin-labeling as a trigger for degradation [swaminathan and tsygankov, 2006; sorkin and goh, 2009], the total amount of egfr in cells expressing cblwt was markedly decreased ( 4a, second and third panel). cells expressing cblk382e, cbld390y, or cblr420q showed very similar egfr degradation kics to that of mock-transfected cells ( 4b), which indicates loss of the stimulating effect of cbl on egfr degradation.  interestingly, it seemed that expression of cblc381a most effecty blocks egfr degradation ( 4b).  we verified these observations by densitometric measurements and statistical analysis of several independent experts ( 4c): cblwt induced a reduction to % of initial egfr after 60-min egf stimulation, whereas mock transfection or expression of cblk382e, cbld390y, or cblr420q resulted in a decrease to %, %, %, and % of initial egfr, respecty ( 4c). these data demonstrate that the promoting effect of cblwt on egfr degradation is impa by dse-associated mutations k382e, d390y, and r420q.  notably, the control mutant cblc381a strongly delayed egfr degradation with only 20% of initial egfr amounts having been degraded at 240 min upon egf treatment ( 4c).  this may indicate additional negatconsequences of the c381a change on egfr trafficking.  figure 4.  open in figure viewerdownload powerpoint slc381a, k382e, d390y, and r420q impair cbl-mediated egfr ubiquitylation and degradation.  (a) egfr ubiquitylation. we documented a tcourse for erk phosphorylation upon egf stimulation and we found no statistically significant differences after 10- and 30-min egf stimulation between cells expressing cblwt and either cells expressing dse-associated cbl protein variant or mock-transfected cells ( 5a and b).  at 60 min upon egf stimulation, cells expressing cblwt showed reduced erk1/2 phosphorylation compared with mock-transfected cells; however, cells expressing cblc381a, cblk382e, cbld390y, or cblr420q did not ( 5a and b).  in fact, phospho-erk1/2 levels were significantly eased in cblc381a, cblk382e, cbld390y, or cblr420q cells relatto cblwt-expressing cells at 60 min upon egf stimulation ( 5a and b). quantification revealed between -fold and -fold higher erk phosphorylation levels in cells expressing cbl mutant proteins or in mock-transfected cells than in cblwt-expressing cells ( 5b).  we conclude that amino acid changes c381a, k382e, d390y, and r420q abrogate the potential of cbl to attenuate ras-mapk signaling.   figure 5.  figure 5.  open in figure viewerdownload powerpoint slc381a, k382e, d390y, and r420q disrupt cbl-mediated downregulation of erk phosphorylation.  a: cos-7 cells were transiently transfected with cbl expression constructs (as indicated) or with empty vector (mock) and cultured under serum-starved conditions overnight. s all tested rasopathy-associated cbl variants and mock-transfection caused very similar degradation kics, we suggest loss-of-function consequences of k382e, d390y, and r420q on egfr degradation.  interestingly, the c381a mutation strongly delayed and blocked egfr degradation.  cyste381 is a key residue for the binding of z an important cofactor for stabilizing the ring domain; mutations may disrupt zchelating loops that accommodate significant contact with e2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes [zheng , 2000].  however, at the moment there is no valid mechanistic explanation for differing functional consequences of the c381a change and the rasopathy-associated mutations, because all of these affect amino acids that seem to be essential for the formation of the binding interface for e2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes [zheng , 2000; martli , 2010].   noonan syndrome and related disorders are associated with dysregulated raf-mapk signal transduction [schubbert , 2007]. we classified all mutations into three groups (damaging, attenuating and benign) according to their expertal relatdensitometry data and compared expertal data with the estimates produced by the computational models.  the first group of damaging mutants uded c396r, h398q, y371h, k382e and c381a which completely abolished cbl activity (relatdensitometry was less than 10%) ( 3b) and the levels of total egfr were not decreased by these mutants ( 3a).  only two of these mutants belonged to the recurrent class of mutations. all fmutants were predicted to be damaging by stability and binding affinity calculations but the mechanisms of their action were different.  c396r, h398q and c381a mutations disrupted zn-coordinating clusters and had very damaging consequences according to the stability model for both ncbl and cbl-s states and damaging effects on cbl-e2 binding even though none of these mutations were located on the cbl-e2 interface.  on the other hand, the k382e mutation did not affect zn-coordination but destabil the ncbl state.
14|| salt bridges are shown as dashed l and in both cases mutation affects the stability by disrupting the salt bridge.  the second group of mutants (m374v, v430m, p428l, q249e and double mutant s80n/h94y) mainta the cbl activity equivalent to or greater than wild-type cbl (relatdensitometry of 80% or higher) ( 3b).  consistent with this, the levels of the activated egfr were also decreased in these samples ( 3a).
15|| mutant cbl constructs were established by pcr-mediated mutagenesis.  purified pcr amplicons (cblwt, cblc381a, cblk382e, cbld390y, and cblr420q) were cloned into pentr/d-topo (ltechnologies, darmstadt, germany) according to the protocol prov.  constructs were sequenced for integrity and used for the transfer into gateway™-compatible destination vector pcdna3-dest, following the manufacturer's instructions. means were consed significant different at p value <.  subsequently, post hoc two-ta unpa student's t-tests were used to determstatistical significance of the difference of the mean values between two conditions each (, cblwt versus cblc381a, cblk382e, cbld390y, or cblr420q).  values are presented as the mean ± sd and were consed significant different at p value <. amino acid substitutions analyzed in this study are indicated.  b: k382e, d390y, and r420q amino acid changes compromcbl function during removal of surface egfr.  cos-7 cells transiently expressing the indicated cbl protein variants or transfected with empty vector (mock) were cultured under serum-starved conditions overnight. post hoc testing was not performed.  cbl amino acid changes k382e, d390y, and r420q alter cellular egfr distribution  if cbl mutations interfere with egfr internalization, the amount of surface and intracellular egfr should be altered in cells expressing mutant cbl proteins.  therefore, we determ the level of surface and intracellular egfr in cells stimulated with egf for 30 min by using surface biotinylation-based assays. expression of cblwt resulted in a clear reduction of surface egfr upon egf stimulation ( 1b, cblwt, precipitates, 30 min) relatto unstimulated cells ( 1b, cblwt, precipitates, 0 min).  in contrast, transfection of cells with cbl mutants ( 1b; cblk382e, cbld390y, or cblr420q) or with empty vector ( 1b, mock) did not induce marked alterations of surface egfr levels ( 1b, compare precipitates for 0 and 30 min each).  in lwith this, cblc381a, a ring finger mutant ( 1a) that has already been shown to perturb egfr internalization [waterman , 1999; thien , 2001] and that we used as an internal control, also did not stimulate removal of surface egfr ( 1b). densitometric measurements and statistical analysis revealed that only % of initial egfr (unstimulated cells) rema at the surface of cells ectopically expressing cblwt; however, cells expressing mutant cbl variants or mock-transfected cells displayed between % and % of initial egfr at the cell surface after 30-min egf treatment ( 1c).  thus, cblwt may promote egf-induced egfr internalization, whereas mutations associated with noonan syndrome-lphenotypes (k382e, d390y, and r420q) as well as the established ring finger mutation c381a may compromthis cbl effect.  even though differences of mean values did not reach statistical significance in these experts by using one-way anova (data not shown), a tendency for impa removal of surface egfr caused by cbl mutations is obvious. cblwt overexpression resulted in a marked enrichment of the intracellular egfr fraction upon 30-min egf treatment ( 2a, blots on the left-hand s precipitates, 30 min) indicating efficient ligand-induced egfr internalization.  cells expressing any of the tested cbl mutants (cblk382e, cbld390y, cblr420q, or cblc381a) showed slightly decreased levels of intracellular egfr relatto cblwt-expressing cells ( 2a, autoradiographs on the left-hand s precipitates, 30 min).  mock-transfected cells also showed reduced amounts of internal egfr compared to cblwt-expressing cells ( 2a, autoradiographs on the right-hand s precipitates;

sorkin and goh, 2009].  first, we monitored the capacity of wild-type and mutant cbl proteins to ubiquitylate egfr upon 30-min egf stimulation by using precipitation-based ubiquitylation assays. overexpression of cblwt resulted in a strong ubiquitylation signal in egfr precipitates ( 4a, top panel; cblwt) relatto mock-transfected cells ( 4a, top panel; mock).  in contrast, transfection of cells with cbl mutants associated with noonan-lphenotypes did not result in augmented egfr ubiquitylation ( 4a, top panel;

cblc381a and cblwt). perfectly in lwith the function of ubiquitin-labeling as a trigger for degradation [swaminathan and tsygankov, 2006; sorkin and goh, 2009], the total amount of egfr in cells expressing cblwt was markedly decreased ( 4a, second and third panel).  these representatdata from one out of three independent experts strongly indicate that dse-associated cbl amino acid changes k382e, d390y, and r420q abrogate cbl ubiquitin ligase activity.  to measure the impact of cbl mutations on egfr degradation, we determ the amounts of total egfr upon 60, 120, and 240 min of egf stimulation. in contrast, in cells transfected with empty vector, egfr levels slowly decreased over the t starting with a slight reduction of egfr at 60 min to a marked loss at 240 min of egf treatment ( 4b).  cells expressing cblk382e, cbld390y, or cblr420q showed very similar egfr degradation kics to that of mock-transfected cells ( 4b), which indicates loss of the stimulating effect of cbl on egfr degradation.  interestingly, it seemed that expression of cblc381a most effecty blocks egfr degradation ( 4b). we verified these observations by densitometric measurements and statistical analysis of several independent experts ( 4c): cblwt induced a reduction to % of initial egfr after 60-min egf stimulation, whereas mock transfection or expression of cblk382e, cbld390y, or cblr420q resulted in a decrease to %, %, %, and % of initial egfr, respecty ( 4c).  these data demonstrate that the promoting effect of cblwt on egfr degradation is impa by dse-associated mutations k382e, d390y, and r420q.  notably, the control mutant cblc381a strongly delayed egfr degradation with only 20% of initial egfr amounts having been degraded at 240 min upon egf treatment ( 4c).  figure 4.  open in figure viewerdownload powerpoint slc381a, k382e, d390y, and r420q impair cbl-mediated egfr ubiquitylation and degradation.

21|| we classified all mutations into three groups (damaging, attenuating and benign) according to their expertal relatdensitometry data and compared expertal data with the estimates produced by the computational models.  the first group of damaging mutants uded c396r, h398q, y371h, k382e and c381a which completely abolished cbl activity (relatdensitometry was less than 10%) ( 3b) and the levels of total egfr were not decreased by these mutants ( 3a).  only two of these mutants belonged to the recurrent class of mutations. all fmutants were predicted to be damaging by stability and binding affinity calculations but the mechanisms of their action were different.  c396r, h398q and c381a mutations disrupted zn-coordinating clusters and had very damaging consequences according to the stability model for both ncbl and cbl-s states and damaging effects on cbl-e2 binding even though none of these mutations were located on the cbl-e2 interface.  on the other hand, the k382e mutation did not affect zn-coordination but destabil the ncbl state.
22|| all mutations from the second group were predicted to be benign according to our computational models, whereas v430m, consistent with expertal data, had a borderldestabilizing impact on cbl-e2 binding (table 1).   finally, the third group constituted mutations (l399v, g375p, p395a and v391i) which attenuated the cbl e3 activity according to the relatdensitometry data ( 3b).  only one of these mutants was observed in two cancer samples whother three belonged to the single mutation class. concordant with this, there were intermediate levels of egfr ( 3a).  g375p and p395a mutations were predicted to have partially damaging effects whv391i and l399v were classified as benign in our predictions.  interestingly, mutations from this third group affected only some of the cbl states.
