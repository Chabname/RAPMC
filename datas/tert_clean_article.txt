27 ||  in one case the proband is homozygous for a novel mutation causing a p704s substitution, while his father's second allele encodes an h412y mutation.  the proband in the second family has mutant alleles y846c and h876q.  transfection studies show codominant expression of the mutated alleles with no evidence of a dominant negative effect or of intragenic complementation.  mutation analysis revealed 2 different tert gene sequence alterations.  the a2537g in exon 9 (y846c) and c2628g mutation in exon 10 (h876q).  further analysis showed that the tert y846c mutation was inherited from the mother, whereas the tert h876q mutation was inherited from her father, indicating that patient  is a compound heterozygote for the 2 tert gene mutations (figure 1a).004; figure 2b).   telomere length in peripheral blood cells from patient  was very short, below the 1st percentile of normal and so were those measured in her mother () and in one of her uncles (), both of whom carry the tert y846c mutation.  telomere length in her father () heterozygous for the tert h876q mutation was between the 1st and 5th percentile of normal (figure 2c).
28 ||  the average sequence coverage at the tert promoter locus was 30-fold in normal samples and 60-fold in tumor samples ( s1a).  each of these promoter mutations resulted in a cytidine-to-thymidine transition at a dipyrimidine motif indicative of ultraviolet (uv) light–induced damage (chr5, 1,295,228 c>t and 1,295,250 c>t; hereafter termed c228t and c250t, respectively), and both mutations localized within 100 base pairs (bp) of the tert transcriptional start site (tss) (mean allelic fraction, ; range,  to ) (table s1).  we validated these mutations by means of polymerase chain reaction and sanger sequencing tumor/normal sample pairs from both the discovery set ( 1a and  s1, b and c) and an extension set of 51 additional melanoma tumor/normal sample pairs. moreover, the mutations were mutually exclusive in both the discovery and extension sets (p =  × 10−7, fisher’s one-sided exact test).  two tumors with a c228t transition also contained an adjacent c>t transition (at position chr5, 1,295,229), which is indicative of a dinucleotide cc>tt transition.  together, these tert promoter mutations were observed in 50 of 70 (71%; 95% confidence interval: 59 to 82%, clopper-pearson method) melanomas examined ( 1b and table s1).    1  1 identification of tert promoter mutations in melanoma and cancer cell lines both c228t and c250t generated an identical 11-bp nucleotide stretch (5′-ccccttccggg-3′) containing a consensus binding site for e-twenty-six (ets) transcription factors (ggaa, reverse complement) within the tert promoter region.  because ets transcription factors may become activated through dysregulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (map kinase) signaling, we hypothesized that these promoter mutations might augment gene expression.  to investigate whether similar tert promoter mutations occur in other cancer types, we examined sequencing data from this locus in 150 cell lines from the cancer cell line encyclopedia (ccle) (3).  overall, 24 ccle lines (16%) contained either c228t or c250t (mean allelic fraction, ; range,  to ) (table s1).  an increased frequency in melanoma was again noted (five of six lines tested), with additional evidence suggesting possible heightened prevalence (>25%; one-sided 95% confidence interval) in bladder (three of three lines) and hepatocellular cancer cell lines (four of six lines) ( 1d). first, the tert promoter mutations showed a combined frequency that exceeded those of braf and nras mutations, which activate known melanoma driver oncogenes (4, 5).  in an analysis restricted to somatic mutations present at an allelic fraction of  or greater [to reduce artifacts of mutation calling (1)], the four most recurrent melanoma nucleotide substitutions included braf [chr7, 140,453,136 a>t (v600e)], nras [chr1, 115,256,529 t>c (q61r)], and the tert core promoter mutations c228t and c250t.  second, although highly recurrent, c228t and c250t occurred in a wholly mutually exclusive fashion. the tert promoter mutations identified here may link telomerase gene regulation and tumorigenic activation in this malignancy.  the high prevalence of c228t and c250t suggests that these tert promoter mutations may comprise early genetic events in the genesis of melanoma and other cancer types.  although tert expression alone is not sufficient to bypass oncogene-induced senescence, genomic tert activation may potentiate mechanisms by which melanocytes achieve immortalization in the setting of oncogenic mutations (8). in those cases in which the neoplastic content was <50%, we microdissected the lesions to enrich the neoplastic content to >50%.  primers were designed to amplify the region containing the two tert mutations that were previously described—c228t and c250t—corresponding to the positions 124 and 146 bp, respectively, upstream of the tert atg start site (14, 15).  the pcr fragments were then purified and analyzed by conventional sanger sequencing.  in all, we evaluated tert promoter mutations in 1,230 tumor specimens and identified 231 mutations (%) (table 1).  c228t and c250t mutations accounted for % and % of the alterations, respectively (dataset s1).  additionally, we detected four mutations that had not been observed previously: three c228a mutations and one c229a mutation (dataset s1).  all four of these mutations as well as a representative subset of the c228t and c250t mutations (n = 59) were somatic, as evidenced by their absence in normal tissues of the patients containing the mutations in their tumors.   table 1. like astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas often progress, and they frequently contain tert promoter mutations (78% of 45 tumor samples) (table s3).  oligodendroglioma was the only tumor type studied (of all types, including non-cns tumors) (dataset s1) in which c250t mutations were nearly as frequent as c228t mutations.  in oligodendrogliomas, 43% of tumors with tert mutations contained c250t substitutions, whereas in other gliomas, only 10% did (p < , fisher exact probability test, two-tailed).
29 ||  both families contain compound heterozygotes.  in one case the proband is homozygous for a novel mutation causing a p704s substitution, while his father's second allele encodes an h412y mutation.  the proband in the second family has mutant alleles y846c and h876q. interestingly, however, the father carries a second tert mutation in exon 2.  this c1234t mutation (h412y), has been previously described in an unrelated family. 3 this mutation reduced telomerase activity to 36% of normal in our transfection experiments (p < .001; figure 2a).  coexpression of wt tert with either the p704s or h412y variants did not show evidence of a dominant negative effect.  the coexpression of the 2 tert mutations resulted in an intermediate telomerase activity of 22% (p < . telomere length measurement in family 199 revealed that patient  has very short telomeres (below the 1st percentile of the normal telomere length distribution; figure 2c).  interestingly, the father (), who is compound heterozygous for the tert p704s and h412y mutations, has also very short telomeres, whereas the mother (), who is heterozygous for tert p704s mutation, has a normal telomere length.   patient  is an 8-year-old girl of european descent, originally diagnosed with moderate but progressive aplastic anemia.

31 ||  to determine whether tumor genomes harbor recurrent mutations outside of protein-coding regions, we systematically queried noncoding somatic mutations using published whole-genome sequencing data.   analysis of whole-genome sequencing data from malignant melanomas (1, 2) revealed two somatic telomerase reverse transcriptase (tert) gene promoter mutations in 17 of 19 (89%) cases examined.  the average sequence coverage at the tert promoter locus was 30-fold in normal samples and 60-fold in tumor samples ( s1a).  each of these promoter mutations resulted in a cytidine-to-thymidine transition at a dipyrimidine motif indicative of ultraviolet (uv) light–induced damage (chr5, 1,295,228 c>t and 1,295,250 c>t; hereafter termed c228t and c250t, respectively), and both mutations localized within 100 base pairs (bp) of the tert transcriptional start site (tss) (mean allelic fraction, ; range,  to ) (table s1).  we validated these mutations by means of polymerase chain reaction and sanger sequencing tumor/normal sample pairs from both the discovery set ( 1a and  s1, b and c) and an extension set of 51 additional melanoma tumor/normal sample pairs. two tumors with a c228t transition also contained an adjacent c>t transition (at position chr5, 1,295,229), which is indicative of a dinucleotide cc>tt transition.  together, these tert promoter mutations were observed in 50 of 70 (71%; 95% confidence interval: 59 to 82%, clopper-pearson method) melanomas examined ( 1b and table s1).    1  1 identification of tert promoter mutations in melanoma and cancer cell lines both c228t and c250t generated an identical 11-bp nucleotide stretch (5′-ccccttccggg-3′) containing a consensus binding site for e-twenty-six (ets) transcription factors (ggaa, reverse complement) within the tert promoter region.  because ets transcription factors may become activated through dysregulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (map kinase) signaling, we hypothesized that these promoter mutations might augment gene expression.  to test this hypothesis, we used a reporter assay system in which the relevant portion of the mutant or wild-type tert core promoter was cloned upstream of the firefly luciferase gene (2). thus, each mutation was capable of augmenting transcriptional activity from the tert promoter.   to investigate whether similar tert promoter mutations occur in other cancer types, we examined sequencing data from this locus in 150 cell lines from the cancer cell line encyclopedia (ccle) (3).  overall, 24 ccle lines (16%) contained either c228t or c250t (mean allelic fraction, ; range,  to ) (table s1). an increased frequency in melanoma was again noted (five of six lines tested), with additional evidence suggesting possible heightened prevalence (>25%; one-sided 95% confidence interval) in bladder (three of three lines) and hepatocellular cancer cell lines (four of six lines) ( 1d).   several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that these promoter mutations may function as driver events that contribute to oncogenesis through tert dysregulation and undergo positive selection, at least in human melanoma.  first, the tert promoter mutations showed a combined frequency that exceeded those of braf and nras mutations, which activate known melanoma driver oncogenes (4, 5).  in an analysis restricted to somatic mutations present at an allelic fraction of  or greater [to reduce artifacts of mutation calling (1)], the four most recurrent melanoma nucleotide substitutions included braf [chr7, 140,453,136 a>t (v600e)], nras [chr1, 115,256,529 t>c (q61r)], and the tert core promoter mutations c228t and c250t.  second, although highly recurrent, c228t and c250t occurred in a wholly mutually exclusive fashion. this suggests the possibility that the mutations might be functionally redundant.  third, the absence of other recurrent somatic mutations in the 3 kb upstream of the tert transcription start site in the queried melanomas (1) coupled with the absence of the described tert promoter mutations in 24 lung adenocarcinomas with comparably high somatic mutation rates (6) reduces the possibility that these recurrent tert promoter mutations are solely due to an increased background mutation rate at this locus.  although the role of telomerase in tumorigenesis is well established, details regarding its dysregulation in cancer cells remain incompletely understood, particularly in melanoma (7). the tert promoter mutations identified here may link telomerase gene regulation and tumorigenic activation in this malignancy.  the high prevalence of c228t and c250t suggests that these tert promoter mutations may comprise early genetic events in the genesis of melanoma and other cancer types.  although tert expression alone is not sufficient to bypass oncogene-induced senescence, genomic tert activation may potentiate mechanisms by which melanocytes achieve immortalization in the setting of oncogenic mutations (8). these results therefore suggest that renewed efforts to develop clinically effective telomerase inhibitors may be warranted.   at the same time, promoter mutations likely represent only one potential mechanism of tert reactivation in a subset of human cancers.  indeed, recurrent chromosomal copy gains spanning the tert locus have been described previously for several cancers, including melanoma (9, 10). together, these findings raise the possibility that recurrent somatic mutations involving regulatory regions, in addition to coding sequences, may represent important driver events in cancer.   tert promoter mutations in familial and sporadic melanoma susanne horn,1,2 adina figl,1,2  sivaramakrishna rachakonda,1 christine fischer,3 antje sucker,2 andreas gast,1,2 stephanie kadel,1,2 iris moll,2 eduardo nagore,4 kari hemminki,1,5 dirk schadendorf,2 *† rajiv kumar1 *† cutaneous melanoma occurs in both familial and sporadic forms.  we investigated a melanoma-prone family through linkage analysis and high-throughput sequencing and identified a disease-segregating germline mutation in the promoter of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (tert) gene, which encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase. concomitant mutations in tert, braf, and cdkn2awere observed in 30% of cell lines compared with the expected frequency of such occurrence of 9% (or , 95% ci  to ).  the high recurrence and specificity of the tert promoter mutations, together with the preliminary evidence from reporter assays that they have a functional effect on transcription, suggest that these mutations are driver rather than passenger events.  extensive functional studies will be required to validate this hypothesis.  the tert promoter mutations were also detected in 25 out of 77 (33%) paraffin embedded primary melanoma tumors (table 1 and table s5) at –124 bp (7/77; 9%) and –146 bp (5/77; 7%).  four primary tumors carried the gg>aa tandem mutations at –124/–125 bp, and eight primary tumors carried the gg>aa tandem mutations at –138/–139 b reduced sensitivity to detect mutations in paraffin-embedded primary tumors because of contaminating normal cells cannot be ruled out. conceivably, tcf may represent a link between telomerase activity and the frequent braf activating mutations in melanoma ( s4) (12, 13).  lastly, whether tert promoter mutations occur in other cancer types remains to be determined.  we did not detect these mutations in a screen of 22 esophageal squamous cell c  reactivation of telomerase has been implicated in human tumorigenesis, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. here we report the presence of recurrent somatic mutations in the tert promoter in cancers of the central nervous system (43%), bladder (59%), thyroid (follicular cell-derived, 10%) and skin (melanoma, 29%).  in thyroid cancers, the presence of tert promoter mutations (when occurring together with braf mutations) is significantly associated with higher tert mrna expression, and in glioblastoma we find a trend for increased telomerase expression in cases harbouring tert promoter mutations.  both in thyroid cancers and glioblastoma, tert promoter mutations are significantly associated with older age of the patients.  our results show that tert promoter mutations are relatively frequent in specific types of human cancers, where they lead to enhanced expression of telomerase.  doi: /ncomms3185 1 institute of molecular pathology and immunology of the university of porto (ipatimup), 4200-465 porto, portugal. such mutations occurred in two hotspot positions, located  124 and  146 bp upstream from the atg start site (  124 g4a and  146 g4a, c4t on opposite strand) and conferred enhanced tert promoter activity1,2, by putatively generating a consensus binding site (ggaa) for ets transcription factors within the tert promoter region1,2.  our aim was to investigate whether the aforementioned tert promoter mutations were present in cancer types other than melanoma, having for that matter screened 741 primary tumours from the thyroid, kidney, bladder, gastrointestinal stromal tumour (gist), adrenal medulla (phaeochromocytomas) and central nervous system (cns).  besides skin melanoma, we have also included ocular melanoma (not studied in the previous reports), benign lesions of the thyroid and skin and 58 human cancer-derived cell lines.  our results highlight tert promoter mutations as frequent events in specific types of human cancers.  results tert mutations in tumours and cell lines.  overall, tert promoter mutations were found in 142 (19%) human tumour samples (table 1;  1a) and 14 (24%) human cell lines ( 1b; supplementary tables s1 and s2).  the  124-bp mutation was the most frequent, being present in 99 cases, whereas the  146- bp mutation was present in 43 cases. two tandem gg4aa mutations at positions  124/  125 and  138/  139 bp were observed in one cell line each (supplementary  s1 and supplementary table s1).  tert promoter mutations were not detected in normal thyroid tissue nor in benign lesions (nevi, thyroiditis, goitres and adenomas).  no mutations were detected in 26 kidney cancers, 17 phaeochromocytomas and 36 gists. tert mutations in cns tumours.  in cns tumours, tert promoter mutations were found in 43% (51/118) of all cases with an equal prevalence of both mutations (table 1 and supplementary table s4).  the frequency of tert mutations was different according to the tumour histology and grade ( 1c): although pilocytic astrocytomas (world health organization (who) grade 1) and diffuse astrocytoma (who grade 2) showed a lower frequency of mutations (8% and 15%, respectively), the most aggressive form, glioblastoma multiforme (gbm; who grade 4), present the highest frequency of tert mutations (62%). after histotype stratification, such correlations were only kept in the group of cptc where we also found significant associations with lymph node metastasis (p ¼ ; fisher’s exact test, two-sided) and brafv600e mutation (p ¼ ; fisher’s exact test, two-sided) (supplementary  s2 and supplementary table s8).

frequency and schematic illustration of tert promoter mutations in human cancers.  graphics depict the overall frequency of tert mutations in the four tumour types where tert mutations were detected (a) and a bar plot showing the number of cell lines of different origin that harbour tert mutations (b). no mutations were detected in 26 kidney cancers, 17 phaeochromocytoma and 36 gists (supplementary tables s10, s11 and s12, respectively).  discussion recent findings have described that tert promoter mutations arise as a novel mechanism of telomerase reactivation/expression in human cancers1,2.  in this work, we report for the first time the presence of these mutations in different histotypes of thyroid cancer, and our results validate the findings reported by others in melanoma, bladder and gliomas1–3. furthermore, we present for the first time evidence showing that tert promoter mutations are significantly associated with increased tert mrna expression in thyroid cancers.  we also found a trend for increased telomerase expression in cases of gbm harbouring tert promoter mutations.  in thyroid cancers, tert mrna was particularly high in cases harbouring both tert and braf mutations. this finding, together with the high frequency of tert mutations in metastatic melanomas1, suggests that, although braf mutations are thought to be an early event in melanoma genesis, tert mutations may occur at a later stage.  no tert promoter mutations were found in ocular melanomas, which, at variance with skin melanomas, harbour gnaq mutations instead of braf mutations4,5.  our results further support the assumption that ocular melanomas result from different etiopathogenic mechanism than skin melanomas5,6. our data on cns tumours indicate that tert promoter mutations are frequent events in gliomas, particularly in gbm where the highest mutation frequency was found.  it has been shown that tert mutations conferred enhanced tert promoter activity in vitro1,2; our findings fit with this assumption because we observed that gbm with tert promoter mutations appear to display increased telomerase expression, despite the limited sensitivity of ihc and the low number of cases analysed.  our results are also in concordance with those of lotsch 7 who reported that 60% of gbms were positive for tert mrna and telomerase activity7.  it will be interesting to assess whether the gbm positive for telomerase activity described by lotsch 7 also harbour tert promoter mutations.  our findings also indicate that tert mutations are associated with older patients, in accordance with a recent report3. on the other hand, these mutations can also result from environmental factors such as ultraviolet radiation and chemical carcinogens as suggested by their high frequency in melanoma, bladder and tongue1–3.  in summary, our data identify tert mutations as common events in human cancers and support the assumption that tert promoter mutations may be one of the mechanisms that underlies telomerase reactivation in several types of human tumours.   introduction the telomere sequences at the chromosomal ends, composed of tandem repeats of ttaggg, are protected by a number of molecules that constitute the capping shelterin complex [1 ;  2]. the normal stem cells in self-renewing tissues retain telomerase throughout lifetime replication thus abrogating a requirement for a positive selection [6].  the recently discovered tert promoter mutations add a new dimension to the acquisition of telomerase activity in human cancers.  in this review we provide an overview and possible implications of the newly discovered mutations in the promoter of the tert gene in a wide range of cancers. the high gc content around the transcription start site of the tert promoter confers epigenetic regulation through methylation and chromatin remodeling [ 37 ;  55].   tert promoter mutations in human cancers a discovery of a high-penetrant disease-segregating causal germline mutation in a melanoma family and highly specific and recurrent somatic mutations in tumors from unrelated patients in the tert promoter has likely provided a definite mechanism for cancer-specific tert activation [ 56•• ;  57••].  two independent studies using diverse approaches discovered non-coding mutations, mainly at two residues, within the core promoter region of the tert gene. subsequent screening of cell lines derived from melanoma metastases from unrelated patients led to the detection of recurrent and mutually exclusive somatic mutations at two residues −124 and −146 from the atg start site in the tert promoter [ 56••].  serendipitously, an independent study using a whole genome sequencing approach also reported the recurrent somatic tert promoter mutations at the same positions [ 57••].  other mutations detected in tert promoter included the cc > tt tandem mutations at −124/−125 and −138/−139 bp from atg start site. pre-existing binding sites for other transcriptions factors are shown above the sequence.  figure options it was also observed that the tert promoter mutations tend to occur more often than expected by chance in tumors with either braf mutations (odds ratio [or] , 95% confidence interval [ci] –) or with concomitant alterations in both braf and cdkn2a (or , 95% ci –) [ 56••].  braf mutations, due to occurrence and role in development of melanocytic nevi, are considered as the driver genetic lesions in melanoma [ 56••; 59• ;  60]. the loss of cdkn2a has been suggested to play a role in the escape of melanocytes from braf induced senescence [61].  the acquisition of tert promoter mutations can be hypothesized to facilitate stabilization of the transformed genome through reversal of telomeric loss.  most melanocytic nevi carry braf mutations, whereas tert promoter mutations and cdkn2a alterations are detected only in primary melanoma and beyond [ 56•• ;  62]. the frequency of the mutations seems to vary between cancer types (table 1).  the highest frequencies of the tert promoter mutations have so far been reported, besides melanoma, in pleomorphic dermal sarcoma, myxoid liposarcoma, glioma, urothelial cell carcinoma of bladder, basal and squamous cell carcinoma of skin, liver cancer and others [ 63••; 64; 65; 66; 67; 68; 69; 70; 71; 72; 73; 74; 75 ;  76].  the mutations occur in other cancer types as well, albeit, at low frequencies [ 63•• ;  67].  based on the prevalence in different cancer types it has been hypothesized that the tert promoter mutations mainly occur in tumors that are derived from tissues with low rates of self-renewal [ 63•• ;  77].  unlike melanoma and other skin related malignancies, no tumor from the cancers affecting internal organs carried cc > tt tandem mutations in the tert promoter with the exception of that at the positions −138/−139 bp from atg start site in bladder cancer.  table 1.  tert promoter mutations in cancers cancer type	mutation frequency (%)a	ref.  bladder

cancer development.  the functional relevance of the mutations was indicated by the basic reporter assays that showed 2–4-fold increased promoter activity [ 56••; 57•• ;  80••]. tumors from thyroid cancers, primary glioma, malignant pleural mesothelioma and liver cancers with tert promoter mutations were associated with higher gene expression than those without mutations [ 67; 69; 72 ;  74].  though limited at the moment, the available data do indicate a tendency of the tert promoter mutations being present in specific clinical and phenotypic subtypes and appear to be associated with adversarial forms of the disease.  while in medulloblastomas the tert promoter mutations were inversely associated with increased otx2 expression; in primary adult glioma, the mutations occurred mainly in conjunction with egfr amplification [ 69]. glioma patients with tert promoter mutations showed an association with poorer survival than patients without mutations; in thyroid cancer, mutations are reportedly more frequent in advanced thyroid cancers than in papillary thyroid cancers [ 63••; 70 ;  71].   the studies on bladder cancer consistently showed that tert promoter mutations are the most frequent lesions with even distribution across all stages and grades [ 65; 66 ;  80••].  intriguingly, an observed interaction has raised a possibility of eventual use of the tert promoter mutations in conjunction with a common polymorphism within the sequence as biomarkers in bladder cancer. the data from bladder cancer showed that the variant allele of a common polymorphism at −245 bp from atg start site in the tert promoter acts as a modifier of the effect of tert promoter mutations on patient survival and disease recurrence [ 80••].  bladder cancer patients with tert promoter mutations in tumors showed almost two-fold decreased survival and increased disease recurrence in the absence but not in the presence of the variant allele for the rs2853669 polymorphism [ 80••].  mechanistic support for the observation was provided by the fact that mutations result in de novo creation of ets/tcf binding motifs; the variant allele of the rs2853669 polymorphism, on the contrary, disrupts a preexisting non-canonical ets2 binding site in the proximal region of the tert promoter, adjacent to an e-box [ 44].   the occurrence of highly specific tert promoter mutations indicates a strong selection pressure for the gene over-expression on path to cellular transformation.  increased telomerase production has been demonstrated to promote cancer progression in an animal model [ 81•].  the effect of the promoter mutations on tert expression can be tenable only in the presence of ets/tcf transcription factors that can specifically bind to the de novo sites created by the mutations.  some of the ets/tcf transcription factors are downstream targets of mapk pathway, where braf is a prominent intermediate [ 82; 83 ;  84].  whether in melanoma activated braf is a driving force in selection of tert promoter mutations remains to be determined.  nevertheless, expression of ets transcription factors is ubiquitous in melanoma and other cancers [ 85 ;  86]. g-quadruplexes have been also implicated in inhibition of telomerase and control of gene expression [100].   conceptual advancement and therapeutic possibilities the tert promoter mutations are thought to represent a conceptual advancement in the sense that those instead of altering an encoded protein modulate transcriptional regulation and represent first evidence of driver alterations in so called ‘dark matter’ of the human genome [ 101• ;  102].  a host of germline variants discovered through genome wide association studies contribute to the susceptibility of various diseases through transcriptional deregulation [103].  while tert promoter mutations represent novel findings in human cancer, alterations in components associated with telomerase assembly, telomere protection or telomere recruitment are known to impact stem cell function and lifespan in mammals through various disorders [ 104 ;  105].   several strategies of therapeutic telomerase inhibition including small molecular inhibitors, immunotherapy, gene therapy, telomere and telomerase-proteins in different cancers have entered clinical trial [106].  it will be interesting to see if the tert promoter mutations, that increase gene expression, influence the current on-going research on targeted therapeutics or if the use of telomerase inhibitors in conjunction with kinase inhibitors like vemurafenib or similar small molecules in melanoma can alleviate recurrent resistance [ 107].  abstract cell immortalization has been considered for a long time as a classic hallmark of cancer cells.edu/).  telomerase promoter mutations and cancer it has been known for 20 years that high levels of telomerase activity can be detected in cancer cells [59]; this contrasts with the fact that mutations affecting the telomerase coding region appear to be very uncommon in cancer [4].  a rare example of neoplasia presenting mutations in the coding region of telomerase is acute myeloid leukaemia in which few tert mutations have been identified [17].we and others reported the presence of recurrent somatic mutations in the telomerase promoter in cancers of the central nervous system (43–51 %), bladder (59–66 %), hepatocellular carcinoma (59 %), thyroid (follicular cell-derived tumours) (10 %), skin (melanoma, 29– 73 %) and tumours originated from tissues with relatively low rates of self-renewal [58, 75, 88, 121].  additionally, other studies reported the association of telomerase promoter mutations to other types of tumours, including atypical fibroxantoma (93 %), pleomorphic dermal sarcoma (76 %) [39], bladder cancer (65 %) [1, 54], basal cell carcinoma (78 %), squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (50 %) [110] and clear cell carcinoma of the ovary [124].  in tables 2 and 3, we summarize the frequency of tert promoter mutations in human cancers with a high percentage of mutations and in human cancers with absent or low frequency of tert promoter mutations, respectively. the in vitro biological assessment of the functional consequence of these mutations, studied by promoter luciferase assay, revealed that their presence results in a two to fourfold increase in telomerase expression [50, 53].  since previously published studies reported high levels of tert expression in the set of tumours with tert promoter mutations [70, 78, 111], it is likely that such alterations may represent one of the missing links between telomerase gene regulation/ reactivation.  telomerase promoter mutations in skin cancers telomerase activity has been reported in normal skin by some authors [43, 118, 119] while other authors suggest that in normal skin, it is a rare event [52, 91]. at variance with the aforementioned reports, burke and colleagues suggested that telomere length can also be influenced by cdkn2a mutational status (a high-risk melanoma susceptibility gene), sun exposure and pigmentation phenotype and therefore cannot be considered a biomarker to predict melanoma risk per se [12].  two seminal papers reported high frequency of tert promoter mutations in familial and sporadic melanoma [50, 53].  in the study from horn and colleagues, a melanomaprone family was investigated through linkage and ngs and a germ-line disease-segregating mutation was identified in the telomerase promoter [50]. huang and colleagues took a different approach, data mining of whole genome sequencing data, publicly available.  they detected the presence of promoter mutations in 89 % of melanoma cases [53].  the mutations clustered mostly, but not exclusively, in two hotspots that are located at −146 and 122 virchows arch (2014) 465:119–133 −124 bps distance upstream of the start site atg [53]. the detected mutations were cytidine to thymidine transitions at a dipyrimidine motif indicating a putative ultraviolet lightinduced damage signature.  these mutations generate a new table 2 human cancers with high frequency (>5 %) of tert

53].  moreover, it was demonstrated in vitro by luciferase assay that the presence of these mutations lead to a two to fourfold increase of the tert promoter activity [54]. tert promoter mutations were not detected in nevi [121] but in 13%of mucosalmelanomas [27].  in primary cutaneous melanomas, tert promoter mutations were found to be associated with braf v600e mutations, worse prognostic features and shorter disease free and overall survival [94, 121].  in ocular melanomas, tert promoter mutations were described in 0 to 32 % of conjunctival melanomas [25, 121]. at variance with the aforementioned data, dono and colleagues observed a case of uveal melanoma harbouring a tert promoter mutation that co-existed with gna11 and eif1ax mutations [25].  tert promoter mutations are frequent in non-melanoma skin cancer, ranging from 39 to 74 % in sporadic basal cell carcinomas (bcc) [37, 94, 110] and present in up to 50 % of cases of squamous cell carcinoma (scc) [37, 110]. telomerase activity has been detected in bcc using trap assay both in tumour and tumour-free margins, varying between 20 and 100 %, with less activity in the latter [29]. telomere length has also been evaluated by fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) showing that higher telomere length in bcc is significantly higher than in scc [93].  telomerase promoter mutations in thyroid carcinomas thyroid tissue is a conditionally renewing tissue that proliferates rarely in adult life.  in line with this, telomerase activity in normal thyroid samples is almost absent, being detected in less than 7%of cases [16, 114]. recently, somatic mutations in the promoter region of tert were reported in thyroid tumours [66, 74, 75, 121].  in a large series of 469 follicular cell-derived thyroid carcinomas

anaplastic thyroid carcinomas (atc) [80].  this stepwise increase in the frequency of tert promoter mutations from well to poorly differentiated and undifferentiated carcinomas was also reported in other studies [66, 74] (table 2). tert promoter mutations were not detected in normal thyroid tissue, benign lesions or medullary thyroid carcinoma (mtc).  moreover, very few tumours with oncocytic features harbouring tert promoter mutations have been reported, and no mutations were detected in a small series of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma nor in tumours from individuals exposed to the chernobyl accident [58, 77, 121].  the majority (about 80 %) of mutated cases presented the −124g>a mutation. in ptc, tert promoter mutations were significantly more frequent in braf-mutated tumours than in braf wild-type tumours [74, 75, 80, 121].  the tert promoter mutations were associated with increased mrna expression, and this increase was particularly pronounced in tumours harbouring both braf and tert promoter mutations [121].  two studies analysed the relationship between tert promoter mutations, clinico-pathological features and outcome. tert promoter mutations were significantly associated with older age at diagnosis [74, 80], larger tumour size and higher stage [80].  tert promoter mutations were also found to be an independent predictor of distant metastases and disease persistence at the end of follow-up in differentiated thyroid carcinomas (dtc) [80].  patients with tert promoter-mutated tumours were submitted to more radioiodine treatments with higher doses as well as to other treatment modalities including surgery, external beam irradiation and/or treatment with tyrosine-kinase inhibitors [80]. tert promoter mutations were significantly associated with disease-specific mortality in the whole fcdtc group; this association held true if the subgroups of patients with dtc, ptc or ftc were independently considered [80].  in dtc, the prognostic value of tert promoter mutations for disease-specific mortality was independent of age and gender [80].  altogether, the aforementioned findings indicate that tert promoter mutations are a major indicator of poor outcome in dt the two studies on record onmtc [59, 123] did not reveal tert promoter mutations in this subtype of thyroid carcinoma.  telomerase promoter mutations in bladder carcinomas the putative role of telomerase in bladder carcinoma (bc) has been a matter of interest in the last two decades.  using trap assay, telomerase activity has been evaluated in bc; telomerase activity was detected in the majority of the studied tumours in contrast to the absence of activity in the respective normal counterpart samples [70, 90]. other studies pointed out that both telomerase activity [70] and telomerase expression [126] are associated with higher stage and higher grade [70, 90].  preliminary evidence obtained in cell lines suggest that bc might have tert promoter mutations [53].  these early results motivated us and others to search for similar events in bladder tumour samples. similar to cell lines, the same tert promoter mutations were detected frequently in bc, with a prevalence ranging from 47 to 85 % (table 2) [1, 54, 61, 77, 99, 121, 125].  these results rank tert promoter mutations as one of the most frequent genomic events, possibly the most frequent, in bc [1, 54, 61, 77, 99, 121, 125].  tert mutations were significantly more frequent among fgfr3 mutant tumours [1]. wu and colleagues reported a significant co-occurrence of tert promoter mutations and tp53/rb1 inactivating somatic mutations [125] indicating that both mutations may cooperatively contribute to the progression of bc [125].  conflicting results have been reported on the association between tert promoter mutations and clinical stage and/or grade of bladder tumours.  wu and colleagues found that tert promoter mutations are more prevalent in muscle invasive (mi) than in non-muscle invasive (nmi) tumours and also more prevalent in bc patients with advanced tumour stages (t2–4) than in those with low stage tumours (ta or t1) [125]. the mutation in the absence of the variant allele was highly associated with disease recurrence in patients with tis, ta and t1 tumours [99].  these results may help to explain some of the divergence reported in studies relating tert promoter mutations and prognosis of patients with b as it was previously noticed, several observations support a model in which tert somatic mutations are an early event in urothelial carcinogenesis, including their occurrence in a small fraction of subjects with precursor lesions, their presence in tumours of both papillary and invasive features and 126 virchows arch (2014) 465:119–133 their low level of intraindividual heterogeneity when analysing multiple tumour regions [1, 58].  tert promoter mutations may potentially be used as urinary biomarker; several studies have already performed preliminary evaluations of the feasibility, sensibility and specificity of such procedure [1, 54]. prospective studies based upon series are necessary to further assess the clinical utility of the detection of tert promoter mutations in urine.  telomerase promoter mutations in central nervous system tumours central nervous system (cns) often have tert promoter mutations competing favourably in this aspect with most other types of human cancer [58, 121].  among cns tumours, gliomas are those displaying by far the highest frequency of tert mutations which can also be detected at lower frequencies in medulloblastoma and meningioma [63]. within gliomas, the percentage of cases with tert promoter mutations differs according to the histopathological type of tumour.  tert promoter mutations are detected in the majority of cases of glioblastoma multiforme (gbm) [world health organization (who) grade iv] which is the most frequent and aggressive form of glioma and in oligodendrogliomas (who grade ii and iii), in contrast to astrocytoma (who grades i, ii and iii) and ependymoma (who grades i, ii and iii), in which only a small percentage of the tumours harbour such mutations (table 3) [63, 121].  furthermore, the percentage of tert promoter mutations in oligoastrocytomas, gliomas with a mixed origin, is intermediate between that of oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas [58]. these findings fit with the reported data on telomerase activity in gliomas which is considerably higher in gbm(50– 89 %) and oligodendrogliomas (75–100 %), than in astrocytomas (0–45 %) [49, 67, 106].  the low frequency of tert promoter mutations and telomerase activity in grades ii and iii astrocytomas can be explained by the high prevalence of atrx mutations, one of the most frequent mutations in this type of glioma [56].  it is known that atrx mutations trigger alt in astrocytoma cells and it has been shown that this alternative mechanism is frequently activated in astrocytomas, allowing telomere maintenance without the need for telomerase reactivation [48]. in line with this, the frequency of tert promoter mutations in secondary gbms (that arise from the progression of lower grade astrocytomas) is considerably lower than in primary gbms (that appear de novo) [89].  tert promoter mutations are rare in paediatric tumours of the cns [63].  in medulloblastomas that typically develop in children, tert promoter mutations are mainly detected in tumours of the group of older patients and are associated with sonic hedgehog and wnt mutations [102].  upregulation of tert expression in paediatric brain tumours was associated with hypermethylation of the tert promoter, rather than with tert promoter mutations [19].  these findings are consistent with the fact that the cells, from which paediatric cns tumours are thought to originate, still have activated telomerase which obviates the need for activation of tert through promoter mutation. although atrx and tert promoter mutations provide an explanation for themaintenance of telomere length in most gliomas, tert upregulation was also reported to occur in a subset of gliomas without tert promoter mutations or atrx mutations through an as yet unidentified mechanism [58].  finally, it is worth noting that, previous to the discovery of tert promoter mutations in gliomas, some studies had reported an association between snps in the tert gene and an increased risk of glioma development [112, 127].  telomerase promoter mutations in other tumour types in tables 2 and 3, we have summarized the data on record on the frequency of tert promoter mutations in tumours from almost every site. for the sake of simplicity, we divided the tumours into those with a high frequency of mutations (>5 %, table 2) and tumours with no mutations or with a very low frequency of tert promoter mutations (<5 %, table 3).  besides the tumour histotypes with high frequency of tert promoter mutations described in the previous sections, there are others in which such mutations appear to be particularly prevalent: hepatocellular carcinoma (56 %), several soft tissue tumours histotypes (e. g. 93 % in atypical fibroxanthoma, 79 % in myxoid liposarcoma and 76 % in pleomorphic dermal sarcoma) and carcinoma of the renal pelvis (64 %) (table 2).  tumour histotypes with intermediate frequencies of tert promoter mutations include laryngeal carcinoma (27 %) and clear cell carcinoma of the ovary (16 %) (table 2).  the latter value contrasts with the absence or very low frequency of mutations in other ovarian carcinomas (absent in endometrioid carcinoma and in high-grade serous carcinoma) (table 3) [124].  in clear cell carcinoma of the ovary, tert promoter mutations tend to be mutually exclusive with the loss of protein expression of arid1a, a tumour suppressor, and with pi3kca mutation [124].  since the pi3k/akt signalling pathway is involved in the activation of telomerase through phosphorylation, wu and colleagues advanced that pi3kca-activating mutations confer a growth advantage on cancer cells by overcoming replicative senescence [124]. at variance with other tumour models (gliomas, melanomas, follicular cell derived carcinoma and others), no associations with disease specific survival were observed for ovarian clear cell carcinoma [124].  there are also differences regarding the putative (early or late) timing of the occurrence of tert promoter mutations in the oncogenic processes of the various tumour models.  tert promoter mutations seem to be present in two settings. as virchows arch (2014) 465:119–133 127 described by killela and colleagues, tert promoter mutations can be relevant in tissues with relatively low rates of selfrenewal [58], an association that fits with the findings in follicular cell-derived thyroid cancer and gliomas.  in these two settings (thyroid cancer and gliomas), tert promoter mutations are associated with a guarded prognosis of the patients harbouring the tumours and probably represent late events of the oncogenic process.  on the other hand, tert promoter mutations can also result from environmental factors such as ultraviolet radiation and chemical carcinogens as suggested by their high frequency in melanoma, basal cell carcinoma and bladder and tongue carcinomas. in this second setting, tert promoter mutations appear to be an early tumorigenic event and do not carry major prognostic value, with the exception of melanoma.  why clear cut differences exist in the frequency of tert promoter mutations in tumours of the same system (e. g. in cancer, telomerase dysfunction has been perceived as a potential mechanism for carcinogenesis although the underlying mechanisms remained elusive.  the recent identification of telomerase promoter mutations in several types of neoplasia fostered the respective research, and in less than a year, numerous studies have been published reporting similar alterations in many cancer models (tables 2 and 3).  in several relevant cancer types, telomerase promoter mutations seem to constitute a new biomarker for prognosis with potential applications in pre-surgical diagnosis and in the follow-up of the patients. this procedure is expensive and time consuming and carries significant morbidity.  the non-invasive evaluation of telomerase promoter mutations in urine may provide diagnostic 128 virchows arch (2014) 465:119–133 information, independent of routine cytology, and most importantly, may identify low-grade tumours, which are difficult to identify by cytological examination alone.  whenever dealing with a recurrence, a non-invasive diagnostic test that also serves as a surveillance method will probably represent an attractive alternative for patients, taking into consideration the limitations of the technique. a preliminary evaluation of the diagnostic usefulness of the detection of tert promoter mutations was already performed in urine samples, and the results indicate that such detection may serve as a biomarker of early disease and recurrence [1, 54].  moving to a trendier subject, it seems extremely interesting to evaluate whether or not tert promoter mutations can be detected in tumour-circulating dna from cell-free fragments in body fluids.  in the affirmative case, this process may represent a major advance in the follow-up of cancer patients. besides them, other mechanisms may modulate telomerase expression, such as novel forms of transcriptional regulation or epigenetic alterations.  we think it is the appropriate time to study large series with robust clinicopathological data and to search for correlations that may establish or rule out the prognostic value of tert promoter mutations in the various types of human cancer.  last but not least, cell and molecular biology studies are mandatory to understand the role(s) of telomerase in cancer cells that appear to go beyond the increased replicative potential (immortalization) and have impact also in metastatic capacities. to further define the tumor types in which this latter mechanism plays a role, we surveyed 1,230 tumors of 60 different types.  we found that tumors could be divided into types with low (<15%) and high (≥15%) frequencies of tert promoter mutations.  the nine tert-high tumor types almost always originated in tissues with relatively low rates of self renewal, including melanomas, liposarcomas, hepatocellular carcinomas, urothelial carcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas of the tongue, medulloblastomas, and subtypes of gliomas (including 83% of primary glioblastoma, the most common brain tumor type).  another challenge to the idea that genetic alterations were not required for telomerase activation in cancer was raised by the finding that mutations of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (tert) promoter occurred in ∼70% of melanomas and in a small number of tumor cell lines derived from various tissue types (14, 15).  importantly, only 5 of 110 cell lines derived from lung, stomach, ovary, uterus, or prostate cancers harbored tert promoter mutations, whereas 19 mutations were found among 37 cell lines derived from various other tumor types.  this situation is analogous to the situation for alt, which is infrequently observed in common epithelial cancers but is observed more regularly in tumors derived from nonepithelial cells, particularly sarcomas and brain tumors (13). a corollary of this hypothesis is that tumor types exhibiting high frequencies of alt would also exhibit high frequencies of tert mutations, and these mutations would be distributed in a mutually exclusive fashion.  to test these hypotheses as well as answer other questions related to the role of tert promoter mutations in various cancer types, we determined the prevalence of tert promoter mutations in a large number of tumors.   go to: results we attempted to evaluate at least 20 individual specimens of common tumor types and fewer specimens of rare tumor types, depending on availability of specimens in our laboratories. the pcr fragments were then purified and analyzed by conventional sanger sequencing.   in all, we evaluated tert promoter mutations in 1,230 tumor specimens and identified 231 mutations (%) (table 1).  c228t and c250t mutations accounted for % and % of the alterations, respectively (dataset s1). table 1.  frequency of tert promoter mutations the 1,230 tumors represented 60 tumor types.  in 26 of these tumor types, at least 15 individual tumors were evaluated (comprising a total of 1,043 individual tumors) ( 1). among the tumor types in which at least 15 individual tumors were available for study, a clear distinction could be made.  eighteen of these tumor types had only occasional tert promoter mutations (zero to three mutations, comprising 0–15% of the tumors of each type) ( 1).  we classified these tumor types as tert-low (tert-l), because they had a low frequency of tert promoter mutations.  eight other tumor types were classified as tert-high (tert-h) because of their relatively high prevalence of tert promoter mutations (16–83% of the tumors of each type).    1.  1.  frequency of tert promoter mutations; 15 or more tumors were analyzed in 26 tumor types.  gliomas are divided into primary gbm, astrocytoma (including astrocytoma grades ii and iii, as well as secondary gbm), and oligodendroglioma. of note, myxoid liposarcomas have been previously shown to have a relatively high prevalence of alt (24% of 38 tumors) (13, 19).  the data, in aggregate, are compatible with the idea that myxoid liposarcomas almost always genetically activate telomere maintenance genes through either tert promoter mutations or alt.   hepatocellular carcinomas. hepatocellular carcinomas (hccs) are the third leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide, and their incidence is increasing in the united states (20).  most hccs in the united states are associated with hepatitis b or c virus infection, whereas others are associated with alcoholic cirrhosis; 44% of hcc samples that we evaluated harbored tert promoter mutations (27/61).  this finding makes tert the most commonly mutated gene yet observed in this tumor type (21, 22). tert mutations were observed in virally associated tumors as well as cases without any underlying liver disease at similar frequencies (table s1).  there was also no difference in the prevalence of tert promoter mutations with respect to sex, age, or ethnicity (table s1).  alt has been observed in 7% of 121 hccs studied previously (13). in 2013, over 73,000 patients will be diagnosed with bladder cancer leading to approximately 15,000 deaths in the us alone (23).  two-thirds of the 21 urothelial carcinomas of the bladder that we studied harbored tert promoter mutations.  we were also able to evaluate 19 urothelial carcinomas of the upper urinary tract, a much less common anatomic site for this histopathologic subtype of tumor. it is the sixth most common cancer in the world, and 50,000 cases occurred in the united states in 2012.  we identified tert promoter mutations in 17% of 70 oral cavity cancers that we evaluated.  however, the anatomic distribution of the cases with tert promoter mutations was striking: 11 of 12 cancers with tert promoter mutations were in the oral tongue, although only 23 of 70 total cases originated in the oral tongue (p < , fisher exact probability test, two-tailed) (table s2). these findings raise the possibility that human papillomavirus infection and tert mutation may be alternative mechanisms to activate telomerase among squamous cell carcinomas.  we were unable to test correlations between tert promoter mutations and hpv status or other clinical parameters because of the small number of patients with available data (table s2).  there have been no alt cases identified among 70 head and neck cancers, including 41 oral cavity cancers (13). 16 y, p = , t test assuming unequal variances, two-tailed) ( s1a).  this observation has important implications for understanding the basis for the selectivity of the tumor types harboring tert promoter mutations (discussion); 45 of 90 patients had been assessed previously for orthodenticle homeobox 2 (otx2) gene amplification and expression, and alterations in this transcription factor are known to correlate with clinically distinct molecular subtypes of medulloblastoma (27).  otx2 expression was >100-fold higher in medulloblastoma patients without tert promoter mutations than in those patients with tert promoter mutations (note the log scale in  s1b). the high levels of otx2 expression were usually the result of otx2 gene amplification ( s1c).  the association of tert promoter mutations with an older age at diagnosis and a lack of otx2 overexpression raises the possibility that tert mutations occur in a specific clinical and molecular subtype of medulloblastoma.  the most likely molecular subtype of medulloblastoma that may be enriched for tert mutations is the noninfant sonic hedgehog subtype, which is characterized by an older age at diagnosis and lower expression of otx2 (28, 29). these high-grade (grade iv) tumors have no detectable precursor lesions and have been referred to as de novo tumors.  the prevalence of tert promoter mutations was remarkably high in gbms of adults (83% of 78 tumors) (table s3).  this prevalence is higher than the prevalence of any other genetic mutation in this tumor type (32). conversely, no association was identified between tert mutation and either tp53 mutation or cdkn2a deletion.  importantly, the frequency of tert promoter mutations was considerably less in primary gbms of pediatric patients (11% of 19 tumors) than adult patients (discussion) (table s3).  alt was observed in 11% of 105 adult gbm and 44% of pediatric gbm (, the reverse of the pattern observed for tert promoter mutations) (13). they are most often grade ii or iii but can progress to grade iv (at which point they are often termed secondary gbms).  astrocytomas of any stage rarely contained tert promoter mutations (10% of 40 total samples) (table s3).  instead, they more frequently contained isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (idh1) or isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (idh2) mutations (75% of 40 tumors), atrx mutations (70% of 40 tumors), and tp53 mutations (73% of 40 tumors) ( 2b).  oligodendrogliomas.  like astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas often progress, and they frequently contain tert promoter mutations (78% of 45 tumor samples) (table s3).  oligodendroglioma was the only tumor type studied (of all types, including non-cns tumors) (dataset s1) in which c250t mutations were nearly as frequent as c228t mutations. this mixture, in part, reflects the difficulties in distinguishing the various glioma subtypes from one another on the basis of histopathologic or clinical criteria (37).  the genetic features of this tumor subtype reflect this mixture: the prevalence of tert promoter mutations (25% of 24 tumors) was intermediate between oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas, as were the frequencies of chromosome (chr) 1p/19q losses and idh1/2, tp53, and atrx mutations ( 2d).   alt vs. alt has been observed in tumors of the cns (particularly gliomas) more frequently than tumors of any other tissue type.  given that tert promoter mutations are also common in gliomas, the relationship between these two features could be determined with high confidence.  the tumors depicted in  2 had previously been evaluated for alterations in atrx, which is a nearly perfect surrogate for the alt phenotype (11, 37). the first of these hypotheses was that tert mutations would only be observed in tumors derived from tissues that are not constantly self-renewing under normal circumstances.  this hypothesis was supported in part: the vast majority of tert promoter mutations occurred in tumors derived from tissues that do not continually self-renew.  the tert-h tumor types include only melanomas, certain subtypes of glioma, medulloblastomas, squamous cell cancers of the tongue, liposarcomas, hccs, and urinary tract cancers. moreover, cells of the pancreas (the islets of langerhans and the ductal epithelial cells) rarely renew, but pancreatic tumors of all types (pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, acinar carcinomas, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas) were all tert-l.  the most that we can conclude at present is that non–self-renewing cell types are the major sources of tert-h tumors but that non–self-renewal is only one of the factors that determines whether tumor cells with tert promoter mutations will have a selective growth advantage over adjoining cells.   the first corollary to the hypothesis raised in the introduction was that tumor types that displayed alt would be those types that harbored tert promoter mutations. this corollary is soundly refuted by these data, at least in general terms.  although tumor types of the cns and liposarcomas had high frequencies of alt as well as high frequencies of tert promoter mutations, these tumor types were the exceptions rather than the rule.  for example, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors have very high frequencies of alt but no evidence of tert mutations.  the second corollary was that the selective advantage afforded by tert mutation would be equivalent to the advantage afforded by atrx mutation (conferring alt).  this hypothesis was most effectively tested in gliomas, in which both atrx coding and tert promoter mutations were common.  there was a striking mutual exclusivity with respect to atrx and tert mutations (p < ), lending strong support to this idea. in some tumor types, such as gliomas, we can imagine that all tumors have genetically activated telomere maintenance programs through mutations in either tert or atrx.  however, in other tumor types with frequent atrx mutations, such as pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, what is responsible for activating telomerase in the fraction of cases not exhibiting alt if it is not a mutation in the tert promoter? similarly, what is responsible for activating telomerase in those tumors derived from non–self-renewing cell types in which neither alt nor tert mutations is frequently observed, such as synovial sarcomas or osteosarcomas? also, there are occasional individual tumors among the tert-l types that have tert promoter mutations (e. g.  the results recorded here have practical as well as basic scientific implications.  two-thirds of bladder cancers had tert promoter mutations, making it the most commonly mutated gene yet identified in invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder.  given the persistently high mortality rate despite multimodality treatment in this group of patients, these mutations represent ideal urinary biomarkers to detect bladder cancers at an early stage and to follow patients for evidence of progression or recurrence once they have been diagnosed (41).  similarly, the high prevalence of tert promoter mutations in hccs and glioma subtypes provides excellent candidate biomarkers for early detection (hcc) or monitoring (hcc in the plasma and gliomas in the cerebrospinal fluid) (42, 43).   another practical implication involves diagnostics.
32 ||  both families contain compound heterozygotes.  in one case the proband is homozygous for a novel mutation causing a p704s substitution, while his father's second allele encodes an h412y mutation.  the proband in the second family has mutant alleles y846c and h876q. half-filled symbols indicate .  mutation analysis revealed that patient  is homozygous for a c to t transition in exon 5 of the tert gene (cdna nt c2110t) causing a proline to serine substitution at amino acid 704 (p704s).  functional analysis in wi-38 va-13 cells demonstrated that the tert p704s mutation severely reduces telomerase activity to 13% of normal (p < .001; figure 2a).  both parents are heterozygous for the tert p704s mutation (figure 1a).  interestingly, however, the father carries a second tert mutation in exon 2.001; figure 2a).  coexpression of wt tert with either the p704s or h412y variants did not show evidence of a dominant negative effect.  the coexpression of the 2 tert mutations resulted in an intermediate telomerase activity of 22% (p < .001; figure 2b), suggesting a synergic effect on telomerase activity and no intragenic complementation.  careful analysis of the family tree revealed that the parents are fourth cousins, explaining the presence of the tert p704s mutation in both parents.   figure 2 figure 2 telomerase activity and telomere lengths of wild-type and mutant individuals. telomere length measurement in family 199 revealed that patient  has very short telomeres (below the 1st percentile of the normal telomere length distribution; figure 2c).  interestingly, the father (), who is compound heterozygous for the tert p704s and h412y mutations, has also very short telomeres, whereas the mother (), who is heterozygous for tert p704s mutation, has a normal telomere length.   patient  is an 8-year-old girl of european descent, originally diagnosed with moderate but progressive aplastic anemia.
33 ||  among them, acral lentiginous melanoma (alm) has distinct epidemiologic and clinicopathologic features.  studies with comparative genomic hybridization have demonstrated that alms are characterized as having a high frequency of amplifications in small genomic regions. 1 some of these amplifications contain genes involved in oncogenesis and tumor progression, such as cyclin d1 (ccnd1) at 11q13 and telomerase reverse transcriptase (tert ) at 52 in a series of 43 formalin-fixed and paraffinembedded samples of infiltrating alm, we have studied ccnd1 and tert gene status by fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish). for tert, noncommercial fish probes using bacterial artificial chromosomes were developed and mctp1 gene was used as chromosome control, as previously described. 3 gene amplifications were considered when the ratio between gene copy number and centromere or chromosome control copy number was greater than 2.  fish results were correlated with clinicopathologic parameters. overall, the median follow-up period was 30 months (mean: ; range: 1-161).  ccnd1 gene amplifications were found in 10 cases (%) with a median ccnd1-to-cep11 ratio of  and tert gene amplifications were detected in 9 cases (%), with a median tert-to-mctp1 ratio of .  ccnd1 and tert amplifications were mutually exclusive. fig 1 shows a fish image of an alm harboring tert gene amplification.  in univariate survival analysis, tert amplifications significantly reduced os (p ¼ . 025), while the patients with ccnd1 amplifications had no significant differences in os (p ¼.987) (see table i).  in multivariate survival analysis, breslow index and tert amplifications retained significance for os (p ¼ . 006; hazard ratio [hr] ; 95% confidence interval [ci] - and p ¼ .019; hr ; 95% ci -, respectively).  in this preliminary study, we are reporting the prognostic value of tert gene amplification evaluated by fish in a series of alms.  tert is a gene encoding for the catalytic subunit of telomerase reverse transcriptase. gene amplification is the most frequent mechanism for tert activation, promoting cell survival and proliferation.  however, the prognostic relevance of tert amplification has only been proved in non-small cell lung carcinomas, to date. 4 recently, recurrent somatic mutations in the tert promoter region have been described in some cancers, including melanomas.5 these results are consistent with the supposed relation of these mutations with the uv light exposure and supports the evidence that melanomas may show different pathogenesis depending on body site and levels of sun exposure. 1 interestingly, we found tert and ccnd1 gene amplifications in different alm subsets, and they were mutually exclusive in accordance with previous studies. 2 this fact suggests that alm may have different pathways of oncogenesis. the tert gene is located at human chromosome band 5p, and the telomerase rna component (terc) gene that encodes tr is at 3q.  chromosomal gains and gene amplifications involving chromosome arms 5p and 3q are among the most frequent in human tumors.  increased tert and terc gene dosage has been detected frequently in a variety of human cancers, and clonal evolution of cells with increased tert or terc copy number has been observed, suggesting a growth advantage in cells with increased tert or terc gene dosage.(17) tert has been mapped to chromosome 5 at 5p(18) and terc has been mapped to chromosome 3 at 3q;(19) that is, both the tert and terc genes are located in regions frequently involved in chromosomal gains.  the gene encoding dyskerin, dkc1, is located on xq28, a region that is also known to be involved in amplification or chromosome gains in cancer cells. (17,20) however, there is no information available about whether the dkc1 gene itself is amplified in human cancer.  gene amplification refers to the situation where there is an array of copies of a restricted region of a chromosome(21) and the region of the chromosome that becomes amplified is referred to as the ‘amplicon’.  gene amplification is common in human cancers and is considered to be one of the mechanisms of oncogene activation.  both the tert and terc gene loci are located on chromosome regions that are frequently amplified in human cancers. for example, chromosome 5p is often amplified in neuroblastoma, lung cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (scc-hn), carcinoma of the cervix, medulloblastoma and osteosarcoma. (20,22,23) amplifications involving 3q have been consistently detected in ovarian carcinoma,(24) carcinoma of the cervix, lung cancer and scc-hn (reviewed in knuutila (20)).   this present study reviews the evidence that the gene dosage of tert and terc are often increased in human tumors.  it should be noted that most studies reviewed here do not distinguish between chromosomal gain and gene amplification.  nevertheless, the outcome for the cell could be similar: both lead to an increase in gene dosage. increased htert copy number in cancer human cancer type	number and types of samples	method of htert copy number analysis	threshold for increased htert copy number	frequency of increased htert copy number	correlation with expression	correlation with activity	references – , not studied; adc, adenocarcinoma; all, acute lympholastic leukemia; anll, non-lymphoblastic leukemia; bac, bacterial artificial chromosome; cgh, comparative genomic hybridization; cmm, cutaneous malignant melanoma; cns, central nervous system; csf1r, colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor; fish, fluorescence in situ hybridization; gapdh, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; hcc, hepatocellular carcinomas; htert, human telomerase reverse transcriptase; nsclc, non-small cell lung cancer; pac, p1-derived artificial chromosome; qpcr, quantitative polymerase chain reaction; sclc, small cell lung cancer; sqcc, squamous cell carcinoma.  cervical, lung, bladder and epidermal carcinomas	15 cancer cell lines	fish using a bac clone 518c13 which is specific for htert	not defined	10/15 cell lines had a modal htert copy number of 3 or more per cell	–	–	(18) neuroblastomas, lung, cervical and breast cancer	26 cell lines 58 primary tumors	fish using specific htert gene probe isolated from pac clone and a reference probe located at 5q31	≥5 copies of htert per cell in ≥40% of the cells (for cell lines)	8/26 (31%) tumor cell lines	yes (for neuroblastoma cell lines)	yes (for neuroblastoma cell lines)	(25) ≥20% of the cells (for primary tumors)	17/58 (30%) primary tumors (1/8 neuroblastomas 8/21 lung tumors, 3/10 cervical tumors 5/19 breast tumors) cervical cancer	4 cervical cancer cell lines	same as above	same as above	1 of 4 (25%) cell lines	yes	–	(27) 88 cervical carcinomas	21 of 88 (24%) primary tumors lung cancer	20 cell lines	fish and southern blotting	fish: not defined	6/20 (30%)	yes	yes	(28) (14 sclc, 6 nsclc)	southern: intensity of htert gene relative to control gene >150%	(5/14 sclc, 1/6 nsclc) melanomas	48 primary cell cultures from 46 cmm patients	fish: using a bac clone containing the htert locus	not defined	frequencies not given, but increase in copy number of chromosome region detected by cgh in 13/50 cell lines	no	–	(32) one culture from a dysplastic naevus	southern: using primers specific for htert melanoma celll line sk-mel-28 cns embryonal tumors	36 cns embryonal tumors	differential pcr: using primers specific for htert and primers specific for 5qsts as the control gene	htert/5qsts ratio ≥	15/36 (42%)	yes	–	(26) ( = twice the mean of normal +3 standard deviations) hepatocellular carcinomas	46 hcc	qpcr: using primers for htert, csf1r (5q) and gapdh (12p13)	ratio of htert/gapdh >2	10/46 (22%)	no	 	(31) colorectal cancer	64 colorectal carcinomas	fish: using a htert locus specific probe isolated from a pac clone; using a 5q31 marker probe as the reference nonamplified gene	≥3 htert copies per nucleus in ≥20% of the cells	31/64 (48%)	no	no	(30) nsclc	qpcr on 81 tumors	qpcr: using primers specific for htert and primers specific for pik3r1 (5q) as the reference nonamplified gene	qpcr: htert copy number > mean of normal +2 standard deviations	qpcr: 46/81(57%) (30/40 adc; 13/37 sqcc)	yes	–	(36) fish on a subset of 59 tumors that had been studied by qpcr	fish: using htert/5q dual-color probe	fish: presence of tight htert gene clusters and a ratio of htert to chromosome 5q ≥2 or ≥15 copies of htert gene per cell in ≥10% of the cells	fish: 37/59 (63%) leukemia	29 all	fish using probes for htert and 5q31	not defined	2–60 copies of htert detected	–	–	(29) 16 anll myeloblastic cell line k562 in addition to fish analysis, tert amplification can also be detected by quantitative pcr.  for example, pcr analysis using primer sets specific for tert and control sequences on 5q (5qsts) detected a tert/5qsts ratio that ranged from  to  in 36 central nervous system (cns) embryonal tumors whereas a mean ratio of  (ranging from  to ) was detected in eight normal subjects. (26) in this study, 42% of cns embryonal tumors had a tert/5qsts ratio ≥ and were considered to have tert amplification. (26)  in various studies, it was found that 25–31% of the cell lines examined had ≥5 tert gene copies/cell in ≥40% of the cells. for example, using fish analysis, palmqvist  defined increased tert copy number as ≥3 tert copies/cell in ≥20% of the cells and detected 48% of 64 colorectal tumor samples that had increased tert copy number. (30) in contrast, using the same technique, zhang  defined tert amplification as ≥5 tert copies/cell in ≥20% of the cells and scored 24–30% of primary tumors as having tert amplification. (25,27)  it is possible that the different thresholds for detection of tert amplication may explain why some of the above-mentioned studies showed a correlation between increased tert copy number and htert mrna expression, while others showed no association. increased tert copy number correlated with htert mrna and protein expression in htert immortalized hmecs(33) but not in htert immortalized human foreskin fibroblasts (cao  unpublished, 2007).  another possible explanation for the lack of correlation between amplification and htert expression is that the amplicon might contain an incomplete copy of the gene.  finally, htert expression has been shown to be regulated at multiple levels involving transcription, alternative splicing, translation and post-translational events (for reviews, see horikawa (34) and ducrest (35)) which provides additional potential explanations for why tert gene dosage does not always correlate with htert expression. it is possible that htr levels may limit telomerase activity in some tumors where increased tert copy number does not correlate with telomerase activity.  our observation that htr levels limit telomerase activity in mammary epithelial cells with tert amplification(33) supports this possibility.   in various types of tumors, increased tert gene copy number has been found to have clinical and prognostic correlates. for example, zhu  showed that lung cancer patients with tert amplification had poorer recurrence-free survival. (36) in hepatocellular carcinomas, htert amplification was found to be associated with poorly differentiated histopathology, which would be expected to correlate with poor outcome. (31) in melanomas, increased tert copy number was significantly associated with the melanoma subtypes and locations of metastases. using terc sequence as the probe in fish analysis, soder  detected more than 10 terc dna signals per nucleus in 4/73 carcinomas of the cervix, head and neck, and lung, and 29/30 (97%) of scc-hn and cervical carcinomas had more than two copies of terc per cell. (19) southern blot analysis using 17 probes spanning chromosome 3q located an amplicon within band 3q26 which included the terc gene, supporting terc as a potential amplification target in tumors of the cervix, ovary and lung.

(40) seven of 12 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (cin) 1/cin2 lesions that progressed to cin3 carried extra copies of terc (and all matched cin3 lesions had extra copies of terc), whereas 0/10 non-progressing cin1/cin2 lesions carried extra copies of ter(41) even more strikingly, extra copies of terc were detected in 4/12 (33%) cytologically normal pap smears from women who later developed cin3 or cervical carcinomas (only 1–3 years after the normal pap smears). given the recent evidence that tert and terc gene products are both limiting for telomerase activity, it would be of considerable interest to know how frequently both genes are amplified in the same tumor or cell.  clonal overgrowth of cells with terc or tert amplification  overgrowth of cells carrying additional copies of terc appears to occur within cervical carcinomas. (40,41) heselmeyer-haddad  observed that in many instances cells with extra copies of terc were located next to each other and this clustering increased with advanced dysplasia.(40,41) it is possible that cells carrying extra copies of terc have a growth advantage, which eventually results in a cervical carcinoma cell population in which the majority of the cells are positive for terc amplification.  it is not clear whether terc amplification correlates with htr expression or telomerase activity in this context, and the mechanism of the putative promotion of cell growth by terc amplification in cervical carcinomas awaits further investigation.   our data indicate that a clone of cells with tert amplification can overgrow all other cells in an in vitro cell population. four independent htert-immortalized mass cultures (b80-tert1, 2, 3a and 3b) were obtained by transfecting hmecs with an htert expression plasmid. (43) extensive amplification of the tert transgene in b80-tert1 cells was detected by fish analysis of metaphase spreads using a probe containing full-length htert cdna or a 650 bp n-terminal htert probe.  a similar pattern of tert amplification was observed in every metaphase ( 1), indicating that this immortalized cell line has become clonal even though it was originally established as a mass culture. fish analysis detected a different pattern of tert amplification in another cell line (b80-tert3b), and it had also become clonal because every metaphase had the same pattern. (33) these observations suggest that cells with tert amplification may have acquired a growth advantage.   figure 1.  figure 1.   open in figure viewer human telomerase reverse transcriptase (htert) amplification in b80-tert1 cells detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis using the full length htert cdna as a probe.  fluorescein-avidin detection of htert is shown in green.(63) studies in mouse knockout models also suggest that this gene is haploinsufficient. (64,65) conclusions  on the basis of the evidence that the levels of both tert and terc are limiting for telomerase activity and that the copy number of these genes is frequently increased in cancers by chromosomal gains or by amplification, we propose that increased tert and/or terc gene dosage is an important mechanism for upregulation of telomerase activity in human cancer.  interestingly, transduction of normal cells with htert expression constructs may result in upregulation of endogenous htr expression, by mechanisms which are incompletely understood. it is also possible that the increased copy number of genes encoding telomerase components has prooncogenic effects in addition to the ability of telomerase to synthesize telomeric repeats, prevent telomere shortening, and permit cells to escape from senescence.  detection of tert and/or terc amplification may have useful applications in cancer diagnosis and prognosis.  realization of this potential will require robust definition of what constitutes a biologically significant increase in tert or terc copy number, and more extensive studies of the clinical outcome in patient cohorts. the regulatory mechanism and clinical significance underlying cancer-specific tert expression have been extensively investigated in various human malignancies, but little is known about these in merkel cell carcinoma (mcc), an aggressive neuroendocrine skin tumor.  here we addressed these issues by determining tert promoter mutations, gene amplification, mrna expression and association with clinical variables in mc tert mrna was expressed in 6/6 mcc cell lines and 41 of 43 tumors derived from 35 mcc patients.  telomerase activity was detectable in all 6 cell lines and 11 tumors analyzed. shorter overall survival was significantly associated with higher tert mrna levels in mcc patients (p = ).  collectively, tert expression and telomerase activity is widespread in mcc, and may be attributable to tert promoter mutations and gene amplification.  higher tert expression predicts poor patient outcomes.   keywords: gene amplification, merkel cell carcinoma, mcv, promoter mutations, telomerase, tert go to: introduction merkel cell carcinoma (mcc), a neuroendocrine skin malignancy, is believed to originate from intraepidermal merkel cells and predominantly occurs in the elderly population or immunocompromised individuals [1-4].  although rare, the annual incidence of mcc has significantly increased in last decades [1-4]. the accumulated evidence has suggested that genetic factors play an important part in regulating tert expression.  we previously showed that tert gene was frequently targeted for amplification in carcinogenesis, which contributed to telomerase activation in human malignancies [11, 12].  it has also been shown that certain single nucleotide polymorphisms increase cancer risk by up-regulating tert expression and telomerase activity [13]. that result indicates widespread telomerase activation in mcc, however, further studies on large cohorts of patients are required to corroborate the finding.  moreover, it is currently unclear how telomerase is activated and how tert expression is induced in mcc, and whether there exists a relationship between tert expression and clinical-pathological features of mc in the present study, we address these issues by determining tert expression, promoter mutation, gene amplification, telomerase activity and their clinical-pathological implications in mc  go to: results telomerase activation and association with clinical variables were analyzed together with tert expression, promoter mutation, and gene amplification using a series of 43 mccs from 35 patients (table (table11 and supplementary table s1) and 6 mcc cell lines.   table 1 table 1 summary of clinical features of 35 mcc patients tert mrna expression and telomerase activity in mcc-derived cell lines and tumors from patients with mcc  a previous study reported detectable telomerase activity in tumor biopsies derived from 4 mcc patients [28], whereas tert mrna expression in mcc has not been investigated so far. both face and temple are uv-exposed areas in the body and there was a significant difference in tert promoter mutations between tumors at these sun-exposed and other areas (p = , fisher’s exact test).   figure 2 figure 2 tert promoter mutations identified in tumors derived from patients with mcc the tert gene amplification in mcc tumors  the tert gene is localized in chromosomal region 5p whereas gains of this region are prevalent in mcc [12, 29, 30].  because the tert amplification was previously found in many kinds of cancer [11, 12], we examined tert gene copy numbers in 6 mcc cell lines and 14 patient-derived frozen tumors using qpcr. normal tert copy numbers were observed in 2 tumors (supplementary table s2).  the presence of tert amplification was not related to anatomic sites of mcc, which was different from the tert promoter mutation.   correlation between tert mrna levels and tert gene amplification in mcc tumors  to see whether the tert amplification plays a functional role in tert mrna expression, we made a correlation analysis between the tert copy number and its mrna level in 14 tumors. as shown in  33 and supplementary table s2, higher tert mrna expression was significantly correlated with increased tert copies in primary mcc tumors (r = , p = ), suggesting a positive effect of the tert amplification on gene transcription.   figure 3 figure 3 positive correlation between tert copy numbers and tert mrna abundance in mcc tumors relationship of mcv with the tert promoter mutation, gene amplification or mrna expression  mcv is implicated in the pathogenesis of mcc [31], and we were thus interested in the relationship between mcv and the tert promoter mutation and tert expression.  in our cohort, 3/6 (50%) mcc cell lines and 25/35 (71%) mcc tumors were mcv-positive (table (table11 and supplementary table s1 and s2). we were unable to perform a correlation analysis on mcv status and tert gene copies due to too few (only one) mcv-negative tumors.   clinical relevance of the tert promoter mutation, gene amplification and mrna expression in mcc  age at diagnosis, gender, tumor size, metastasis and recurrence were not associated with the tert promoter mutation and gene amplification (supplementary table s4).  however, higher tert mrna expression was more frequently observed in male patients (p = ). in 24 evaluable mcc patients, lower levels of tert mrna expression in tumors were significantly associated with longer overall survival time [p = , log-rank (mantel-cox) test;  44].   figure 4 figure 4 significant correlation between the tert mrna level and overall survival in mcc patients go to: discussion in the present study, we performed a comprehensive analysis on the genetic regulation of tert expression and its clinical-pathological association in mc our results demonstrate that (i) tert expression and telomerase activity is highly prevalent in mcc; (ii) tert promoter mutations are identified in > 10% of mcc, and most frequently occur at sun-exposed areas and mcv-negative tumors; (iii) the tert gene amplification is widespread and positively correlated with tert expression levels in mcc; and (iv) higher levels of tert mrna expression are significantly associated with shorter survival time in mcc patients.  these findings provide important insights into the regulatory mechanism underlying telomerase activation in mcc and may be implicated in future mcc management. these features were similarly observed in malignant melanoma and other skin cancers [15, 16, 25].   compared to the tert promoter mutation, the tert amplification is more prevalent in mc we found that 11 of 14 examined mcc tumors (79%) harbored the increased tert copy number.  this result is consistent with previous cytogenetic and cgh data showing the frequent regional or whole arm gains of 5p where the tert locus is localized [4, 29, 30]. unlike the promoter mutation, the tert amplification occurs in both sun-exposed and other areas, reflecting its irrelevance with uv irradiation [4, 29, 30].  notably, there exists a highly positive correlation between the tert gene copy number and its mrna level, which indicates a functional impact of the tert amplification on the tert transcription in mc taken together, the tert gene amplification plays a significant role in telomerase activation during the development of mc  a number of oncogenic viruses target the tert gene by de-repressing its transcription for telomerase activation [32, 33].  because mcv is frequently detected in mcc and implicated in the disease pathogenesis, we are interested in a potential association between the virus infection and tert promoter mutation or gene amplification. this is similar to that observed in hepatocellular carcinomas where the tert promoter mutation is significantly more frequent in patients without hepatitis virus b infection [18].  owing to the limited number of patients, the relationship between the virus status and tert amplification remains to be defined.  it is currently unclear whether mcv, like other viruses, regulates tert expression at the transcriptional level. further investigations on a larger cohort of patients are required to address this issue.  nevertheless, a significant association between higher tert expression and shorter patients’ survival observed in the present study indicates that tert may serve as prognostic marker and be a therapeutic target for mc  in summary, the study presented here reveals a widespread tert expression and telomerase activation in mc the tert gene amplification and promoter mutation may significantly contribute to the de-repression of tert transcription, whereas higher levels of tert expression consequently contribute to poor patients’ outcomes.  moreover, given multi-biological activities of tert/telomerase in cancer development and progression, [35] and telomerase-based cancer therapy as a novel anti-cancer strategy [26], it is worth of determining whether the combination of conventional therapeutic approaches with telomerase inhibitors is capable of improving treatment efficacy and survival in mcc patients.
34 ||  the average sequence coverage at the tert promoter locus was 30-fold in normal samples and 60-fold in tumor samples ( s1a).  each of these promoter mutations resulted in a cytidine-to-thymidine transition at a dipyrimidine motif indicative of ultraviolet (uv) light–induced damage (chr5, 1,295,228 c>t and 1,295,250 c>t; hereafter termed c228t and c250t, respectively), and both mutations localized within 100 base pairs (bp) of the tert transcriptional start site (tss) (mean allelic fraction, ; range,  to ) (table s1).  we validated these mutations by means of polymerase chain reaction and sanger sequencing tumor/normal sample pairs from both the discovery set ( 1a and  s1, b and c) and an extension set of 51 additional melanoma tumor/normal sample pairs. together, these tert promoter mutations were observed in 50 of 70 (71%; 95% confidence interval: 59 to 82%, clopper-pearson method) melanomas examined ( 1b and table s1).    1  1 identification of tert promoter mutations in melanoma and cancer cell lines both c228t and c250t generated an identical 11-bp nucleotide stretch (5′-ccccttccggg-3′) containing a consensus binding site for e-twenty-six (ets) transcription factors (ggaa, reverse complement) within the tert promoter region.  because ets transcription factors may become activated through dysregulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (map kinase) signaling, we hypothesized that these promoter mutations might augment gene expression.  to investigate whether similar tert promoter mutations occur in other cancer types, we examined sequencing data from this locus in 150 cell lines from the cancer cell line encyclopedia (ccle) (3).  overall, 24 ccle lines (16%) contained either c228t or c250t (mean allelic fraction, ; range,  to ) (table s1).  an increased frequency in melanoma was again noted (five of six lines tested), with additional evidence suggesting possible heightened prevalence (>25%; one-sided 95% confidence interval) in bladder (three of three lines) and hepatocellular cancer cell lines (four of six lines) ( 1d). first, the tert promoter mutations showed a combined frequency that exceeded those of braf and nras mutations, which activate known melanoma driver oncogenes (4, 5).  in an analysis restricted to somatic mutations present at an allelic fraction of  or greater [to reduce artifacts of mutation calling (1)], the four most recurrent melanoma nucleotide substitutions included braf [chr7, 140,453,136 a>t (v600e)], nras [chr1, 115,256,529 t>c (q61r)], and the tert core promoter mutations c228t and c250t.  second, although highly recurrent, c228t and c250t occurred in a wholly mutually exclusive fashion. the tert promoter mutations identified here may link telomerase gene regulation and tumorigenic activation in this malignancy.  the high prevalence of c228t and c250t suggests that these tert promoter mutations may comprise early genetic events in the genesis of melanoma and other cancer types.  although tert expression alone is not sufficient to bypass oncogene-induced senescence, genomic tert activation may potentiate mechanisms by which melanocytes achieve immortalization in the setting of oncogenic mutations (8).  transcriptional reactivation of tert, the catalytic subunit of telomerase, is necessary for cancer progression in about 90% of human cancers.  the recent discovery of two prevalent somatic mutations—c250t and c228t—in the tert promoter in various cancers has provided insight into a plausible mechanism of tert reactivation.  although the two hotspot mutations create a similar binding motif for e-twenty-six (ets) transcription factors, we show that they are functionally distinct, in that the c250t unlike the c228t tert promoter is driven by non-canonical nf-κb signalling. clearly, understanding how the human tert (htert—hereafter referred as tert) promoter is reactivated in cancers is key to unravelling a fundamental mechanism of cancer progression.  recently, two mutually exclusive and highly recurrent mutations in the core tert promoter—c250t or c228t (refs 13, 14)—were described, providing a plausible handle for studying the mechanism of tert reactivation.   several transcription factors including myc, β-catenin and nf-κb have been proposed to be drivers of the tert promoter, on the basis of evidence that binding sites for these factors exist on the tert promoter15,16. as nf-κb-dependent activation of tumour-promoting pathways has been implicated in the pathogenesis of glioblastoma multiforme20 (gbm), the most aggressive form of brain malignancy with high telomerase activity21, we examined whether nf-κb mediates transcription of tert in gbm.  surprisingly, we uncover a nf-κb-binding site in the tert promoter that specifically maps to one of the two hotspot mutations (c250t or c228t; refs 13, 14) in the core tert promoter and show that this binding is essential for activation of the mutant tert promoter.  although enhanced transcriptional activity of the tert promoter has been correlated with c250t or c228t mutations22–24, the definite mechanism(s) underscoring the induction of tert transcription by these mutations remain poorly understood. it is not clear whether both mutations lead to activation of the promoter by similar mechanisms.  our data suggest that the two tert promoter mutations that were predicted to generate the same ets-binding site are functionally distinct, in that the c250t unlike the c228t tert promoter is driven by non-canonical nf-κb signalling.  consistent with literature25,26 that suggests that ets factors require dimerization with other transcription factors for transactivation, we find that binding of ets alone to the c250t mutant tert promoter is insufficient to activate transcription. efficient reactivation of tert at this mutant promoter requires cooperation with p52, downstream of non-canonical nf-κb signalling.   go to: results non-canonical nf-κb signalling selectively induces tert expression in c250t-mutant cells  the nf-κb signalling pathway is functionally segregated into canonical and non-canonical arms27.  results from gbm cells stimulated with tnf-α and tweak (tumour necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis), which activate the canonical and non-canonical nf-κb arms respectively, showed that although tnf-α caused a strong induction of nf-κb target genes—il-8 and i κ bα in all gbm cell lines—it did not cause changes in tert expression (supplementary  1a). sequencing the tert promoter region of these cell lines unexpectedly led to a distinct segregation of these lines that induce tert after tweak stimulation, based on their tert promoter mutation status ( 1b).  upregulation of tert in gbm cells containing the c250t mutation correlated with a strong induction of telomerase activity in c250t-mutant cells ( 1c).  it is noteworthy that small changes in tert transcription are sufficient for a significant increase in telomerase activity28,29.   figure 1 figure 1 tweak-induced non-canonical nf-κb signalling regulates tert expression and telomerase function in c250t gbm cells.  (a) gbm cell lines were treated with tweak for one or two days and analysed for tert expression by qpcr. 32), which forms a heterodimer with relb, leading to transcriptional activation of selective nf-κb target genes33,34.  gbm cells carrying the c228t mutation did not show induction of tert or significant differences in telomerase activity following tweak stimulation ( 1a,c), although these cell lines express similar levels of fn14 and levels of tweak-induced nuclear p52 and relb accumulation seen were comparable to c250t cells (supplementary  1b,c).  these results suggest that although similar levels of p52/relb are activated in all gbm cells, only the c250t-mutant tert promoter is responsive to these dimers. consistent with the induction of tert transcription and telomerase activity, c250t-mutant gbm cells exhibited a significant increase in p52 occupancy on the tert promoter whereas no p52 enrichment was seen in c228t gbm cells ( 1d).  specific enrichment of p52 at the c250t tert promoter following tweak stimulation also led to increased rna polymerase ii (pol ii) recruitment ( 1d).  in contrast to the tert promoter, tweak-induced p52 and pol ii enrichment at a known p52 target gene promoter, namely blc (b lymphocyte chemoattractant or cxcl13), occurred with similar efficiency in both c250t and c228t gbm lines (supplementary  2a). lentiviral knockdown of p52, relb and nik abolished the induction of tert in tweak-stimulated c250t gbm cells, verifying that tweak-mediated effects on the c250t tert promoter are specifically mediated through non-canonical nf-κb signalling ( 1e and supplementary  2b).  association of p65 (rela) at the tert promoter was not observed in tweak-induced c250t gbm cells ( 1d).  furthermore, tnf-α stimulation failed to recruit p52 to the tert promoter (supplementary  2c) although efficient p65 and pol ii recruitment to the canonical target gene promoter, nf-κ b1a, was observed (supplementary  2d).   these observations were also recapitulated when t98g and u251 cells, containing the c250t and c228t tert mutations respectively, were stimulated with agonistic human ltβr antibody, another ligand that activates non-canonical nf-κb signalling34,35.  although anti-ltβr stimulated a similar pattern of p100 processing to p52 in both cell lines (supplementary  3a), significant induction of tert messenger rna was seen in t98g but not in u251 cells (supplementary  3b). these findings corresponded with a significant enrichment of p52 and pol ii at the tert promoter in t98g cells but not in u251 cells (supplementary  3c), although similar levels of p52 and pol ii recruitment at the blc promoter were detected in all cells with anti-ltβr (supplementary  3d).  increased occupancy of p52 on the c250t tert promoter correlated with their enhanced proliferation (supplementary  3e) as well as increased telomerase activity after anti-ltβr treatment (supplementary  3f).  in contrast, anti-ltβr-treated u251 cells exhibited no difference in proliferation and telomerase activity (supplementary  3e,f). taken together, these findings suggest that non-canonical nf-κb signalling specifically activates the c250t tert promoter in human gbm cells.   c250t tert promoter mutation creates a p52-binding site  nf-κb dimers bind the consensus sequence 5′-gggrn(y)yycc-3′.  however, the nucleotide sequence spanning the c250t mutation site does not form a complete nf-κb consensus motif. although nf-κb dimers have been observed to bind only one half-site (5′-ggggg-3′ or 5′-ggaa-3′) in vitro36, in vivo half-site binding of nf-κb dimers, especially p52/relb, has not been investigated.  we thus examined whether p52 can bind half-site at the c250t tert promoter using the only available in vivo p52 chip-seq data from lymphoblastoid b cells37.  through de novo motif analysis38–40, we identified the palindromic p52 motif from 12,239 p52 chip-seq peaks ( 2a) and analysed these binding regions for p52 half-site binding in vivo. we therefore provide evidence that p52 binds to half-sites in vivo.   figure 2 figure 2 c250t tert promoter mutation creates a p52-binding site.  (a) sequence logo of the p52 motif de novo discovered by thermos (ref. the 11-base-pair motif is palindromic with the left and right half-sites separated by .  the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (emsa) demonstrated enhanced binding on the dna probe containing the c250t tert promoter sequence relative to the wild-type (wt) tert promoter ( 2c, lanes 1–2) using nuclear extracts from the c250t line t98g.  whereas activation of nf-κb dna binding to its established consensus motif was dependent on tnf-α stimulation ( 2d, lanes 3–4), dna binding to the c250t tert promoter was unperturbed by tnf-α stimulation ( 2d, lanes 7–8). this is consistent with earlier observations that regulation of the c250t tert promoter is independent of canonical nf-κb signalling.  supershift emsa with antibodies targeting nf-κb2 (p100/p52) and relb diminished protein binding to the c250t tert promoter ( 2e, lanes 3–5).  in contrast, antibodies targeting c-rel and unspecific igg did not affect protein binding on the c250t tert promoter ( 2e, lanes 6–7).  to verify the functional implications of p52/relb binding on the c250t tert promoter, we performed short interfering rna (sirna) experiments on t98g and u251 cells.  significant downregulation of tert was observed in t98g cells but not in u251 cells following downregulation of nf-κb2 and relb (supplementary  3g).  enhanced binding to the c250t tert promoter was observed with tweak stimulation ( 2f, lanes 1–2) and this binding was disrupted by antibodies against nf-κb2 (p100/p52) and relb but not c-rel and igg ( 2f, lanes 3–6).  relb does not possess dna-binding activity as a homodimer but rather mediates its transactivation function by forming a heterodimer with p52 (refs 42,43).  recombinant p52 robustly bound to the c250t tert promoter in a dose-dependent manner (supplementary  4a, lanes 4–6) whereas gst protein did not (supplementary  4a, lane 7).  a dna probe containing the known human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) κb binding sites for p52 (ref. 43) was used a control for p52 binding (supplementary  4a, lanes 2–3).  binding of p52 to the c250t tert promoter was completely abolished when two residues in the rel homology region (rhr) critical for dna binding were mutated (supplementary  4b, lane 6).  taken together, these results provide evidence for a p52 binding site on the c250t tert promoter and demonstrate a previously unrecognized function of non-canonical nf-κb signalling in regulation of tert transcription.   non-canonical nf-κb activation enhances tumorigenicity of c250t-mutant gbms by increasing telomerase activity  nik is a map3k kinase that signals downstream of tweak/fn14 and ltβr to induce phosphorylation of p100 by iκb kinase α (ikkα), leading to p100 ubiquitylation and processing to p52 (refs 33,34).  thus, nik overexpression activates the non-canonical nf-κb pathway, resulting in the generation of mature p52 (ref. 44).  ectopically expressed nik upregulated tert expression in t98g cells whereas expression of kinase-inactive mutant nik (nik kk) did not ( 3a and supplementary  5a), indicating that nik-induced processing of p100 was necessary for activation of the c250t tert promoter.  this was consistent with the significant enrichment of p52 and pol ii at the tert promoter (supplementary  5b) and the induction of telomerase activity in nik-expressing t98g cells (supplementary  5c). these findings were consistent with reporter assays using these tert promoters.  ectopic expression of nik augmented the transcriptional activity at the c250t tert promoter-driven but not wt tert promoter-driven luciferase and this effect was not seen when nik kk was expressed (supplementary  5e).  furthermore, tweak treatment resulted in increased transcriptional activity at the c250t tert promoter but not the wt tert promoter (supplementary  5f).   figure 3 figure 3 ectopic expression of nik promotes telomerase function and proliferation of c250t gbm cells.  (a) relative tert expression was analysed in t98g and u251 cells transfected with vector, human nik wt or kinase-inactive mutant nik (kk) vector constructs. ectopic expression of nik in t98g cells caused increased cell proliferation ( 3b,c), which was abolished following treatment with sirna against tert ( 3d,e), suggesting that the nik-mediated growth advantage depends on upregulation of tert and hence telomerase activity.  induction of tert mrna and cell proliferation in nik-expressing c250t cells were abrogated following treatment with sirna against nf-κb2 and relb but not rela, further suggesting that nik-regulated activation of the c250t tert promoter is mediated through the non-canonical nf-κb pathway ( 3f,g and supplementary  5g,h).  ectopic expression of nik (supplementary  6a) markedly enhanced in vivo tumour growth of t98g cells ( 4a,b and supplementary  6b,c), which were previously reported to be non-tumorigenic in immunodeficient mice45. one of three mice implanted with vector t98g cells developed an intracranial tumour, but all three mice bearing nik-expressing t98g cells developed gliomas and this increased tumorigenesis was completely abolished by p52 knockdown ( 4c).  these observations therefore support the critical role of the non-canonical nf-κb pathway in activating tert expression and telomerase function through the c250t tert promoter, hence potentiating in vivo tumorigenicity.  we also analysed nik and tert expression levels in primary human tumours derived from gbm patients using immunohistochemical (ihc) staining, and simultaneously sequenced genomic dna extracted from the same tumour material for tert promoter mutations.  from the 29 gbm tumours analysed, 28% and 38% of the samples harboured c250t (n=8) and c228t (n=11) tert mutations respectively, 34% of tumours were wt for the tert promoter (n=10) ( 4d).  tumours containing tert promoter mutations exhibited increased tert expression compared with wt tumours ( 4d).  in particular, c250t-positive tumours had significantly higher tert expression compared with wt tumours (p=; t-test, two-tailed;  4d).  tumours with the c228t mutation showed a trend of higher tert levels as compared with wt tumours, although the difference was not statistically significant (p =; t-test, two-tailed;  4d).  further ihc analysis of these tumours for nik expression revealed a positive correlation (p =; linear regression test) between increased nik expression and high tert levels particularly in c250t tumours ( 4e,f).  this association between elevated nik levels and tert overexpression in gbm tumours was not seen in wt tumours or in c228t tumours ( 4e,f). these findings highlight the significant concordance between enhanced nik expression and increased telomerase expression in gbm tumours carrying the c250t mutation.   figure 4 figure 4 constitutive non-canonical nf-κb activation promotes in vivo tumorigenicity of c250t gbm cells.  (a) t98g cells expressing vector, nik wt or nik p52 shrna were injected subcutaneously into 5 nod-scid mice per grou picture shows tumours isolated . targeted reversal of c250t mutation abolishes activation of tert by p52  to confirm whether p52 binds the c250t loci and no other location on this promoter, we targeted this mutation site using crispr/cas9 technology to reverse this point mutation to the wt in the genome of t98g cells.  two guide rnas targeting the tert promoter were each selected to mediate a single cas9 endonuclease-induced double-stranded break at either loci adjacent to c250t mutation site ( 5a) and single-stranded oligonucleotides containing the wt tert promoter sequence were co-transfected into t98g cells to mediate genome editing.  we obtained three t98g clones that carried the wt tert promoter sequence—two het clones with one copy of the thymine residue repaired to cytosine and one clone with both alleles edited ( 5b). reversal of the c250t mutation to wt resulted in an appreciable reduction of telomerase activity ( 5c) and proliferation ( 5d,e) of all three wt clones, relative to a c250t-positive clone that was similarly isolated following the crispr/cas9 screen.  furthermore, c250t reversal abolished tweak-mediated induction of tert expression ( 5f) and telomerase function ( 5g) in all three wt clones but not the c250t-positive clone, which retained similar telomerase activity as control t98g cells ( 5c).  consistently, tweak-induced recruitment of p52 and pol ii to the tert promoter was abrogated following c250t reversal ( 5h) although similar enrichment of the two factors was found at the blc promoter, on tweak stimulation, in both the c250t-positive and wt clones ( 5i). these findings therefore reaffirm that this single hotspot mutation generates a binding site for p52 that drives tert reactivation in gbms.   figure 5 figure 5 crispr/cas9-mediated reversal of the c250t mutation abolishes p52 activation of the tert promoter.  (a) grnas targeting the tert promoter at various loci adjacent to the c250t mutation site were cloned into pspcas9 (bb) vector and co-transfected with a .  p52 interacts with ets factors at the c250t tert promoter to mediate tert reactivation  the c>t transition is predicted to create a binding motif for the e-twenty-six (ets) family of transcription factors (ggaa, opposite strand)13,14.  as nf-κb factors have been previously demonstrated to interact with ets proteins46,47, we performed immunoprecipitation with anti-flag beads in t98g cells expressing flag-tagged p52. consistent with this, chip re-chip showed ets1/2 association with p52 at the tert promoter in t98g cells ( 6b).  furthermore, knockdown of ets1/ets2 or nik similarly reduced proliferation in c250t-mutant gbm cells ( 6c–f).  ets1/ets2 are known to be auto-inhibited and require cooperative binding with another transcription factor by forming a homodimer25,26 or a heterodimer48 for dna-binding activities. our experimental results show that ets1/2 and p52 co-bind the c250t region but not the c228t region.  as both c250t and c228t tert mutations generate the same ets consensus motif de novo, we examined the tert promoter region spanning both mutation sites for cooperative binding between ets and p52/relb to explain the differential response observed.  using taco to predict co-association of ets–p52/relb heterodimers at the chromatin49, we found all three dimers to be highly enriched in two cell lines (adjusted p value of less than ;  7a) the consensus of the three dimers 5′-ntccnn(t/a)tcc-3′ indicates that p52 and ets1 may form a heterodimer with a 2-base-pair (bp) space. however, it is worth noting that both 5′-t1c2c3-3′ half-sites require a t at position 1 instead of a  no enrichment of another p52/relb half-site motif 5′-ncccc-3′ in the dimers also highlights the importance of t in both half-sites.  we therefore aligned the consensus of the enriched dimer to the c250t and c228t regions and found that the c250t region perfectly matches the two ‘tcc’ half-sites with the correct spacing.  in contrast, the c228t region lacks a t on the right half-site, which may explain the less favourable binding of the p52/ets1 heterodimer to the c228t region ( 7a).   figure 6 figure 6 ets factors regulate proliferation of gbm cells and interact with p52 at the c250t tert promoter.  (a) p52 interacts with both ets1 and ets2. lysates of flag–p52-overexpressing t98g cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-flag beads and analysed .  figure 7 figure 7 p52 cooperates with ets factors at the c250t tert promoter.  (a) cooperative binding between p52/relb and ets1 predicted by taco (ref. to verify cooperative binding between p52 and ets factors in vitro, we performed emsa using recombinant p52 and ets1 proteins.  whereas p52 bound both the wt and c250t tert promoters ( 7b, lanes 1 and 4), we found that ets1 bound specifically to the mutant tert promoter ( 7b, lanes 2 and 5), which supports current evidence that tert promoter mutations generate ets binding sites de novo13,14,50.  our chip analysis further confirmed that ets1 can bind the c250t tert promoter without stimulation ( 7c). notably, addition of p52 and ets1 proteins to the mutant tert promoter resulted in enhanced binding of p52/ets and a complex of higher mobility ( 7b, lane 6), thus validating our bioinformatics prediction.  sirna against ets1/ets2 reduced the induction of tert expression in tweak-treated t98g cells ( 7d), and decreased p52 and pol ii enrichment at the tert promoter ( 7e), suggesting that ets1/2 occupancy at the c250t tert promoter is critical for p52-mediated activation of tert transcription.  notably, p52 enrichment at the tert promoter was completely abolished in t98g cells treated with ets1 sirna ( 7e), which is probably attributed to the predominant expression of ets1 and its association with p52 in t98g cells ( 6a; red asterisk). correspondingly, the increase in telomerase activity was abrogated in all three tweak-induced c250t gbm cell lines that were pre-treated with sirnas targeting ets1 or ets2 ( 7f).   go to: discussion we uncover a nf-κb-binding site in the c250t mutant tert promoter that is essential for its activation.  we show that the c250t tert promoter, unlike c228t, is driven by non-canonical nf-κb signalling. binding of ets factors to the c250t-mutant tert promoter in the absence of non-canonical nf-κb signalling is insufficient to activate tert transcription and efficient reactivation requires cooperation with the p52 subunit of nf-κb, downstream of non-canonical nf-κb signalling.  we also show that ets–p52 cooperation occurs only in context of the mutant c250t sequence ( 7a,b) and these data explain why tert is not activated by nf-κb signalling in somatic cells with the wt tert promoter sequence.  on the basis of the results presented, we propose a model for telomerase reactivation in human cancers harbouring c250t tert promoter mutations ( 7g). tert expression is low when ets1/2 alone is bound at the c250t promoter.  on activation of non-canonical nf-κb signalling through exogenous ligands (for example, tweak) or constitutive nik expression, p52 is recruited to the c250t promoter and cooperates with ets factors to drive efficient tert transcription ( 7g).  enhanced tert expression promotes telomerase activity, necessary for cancer progression ( 4a–c).  strong support for this model is provided by the evidence that the c250t mutation site when reversed to wt status by crispr/cas9 loses ets1/2 binding and p52 is no longer recruited or stabilized at the tert promoter ( 5h,i), resulting in the loss of tert expression ( 5f), telomerase activity ( 5g) and cancer cell growth ( 5d,e).  although recombinant p52 binds in vitro to the wt tert promoter ( 7b), this half-site binding at non-physiological concentrations is not reflective of in vivo interactions as demonstrated by chip ( 5h). indeed recent studies have documented increased levels of relb and nik in human gbms (refs 63,64), implicating the role of non-canonical nf-κb signalling in gbm survival and tumour progression.  we conclude that the non-canonical nf-κb pathway is essential for telomerase reactivation in human cancers harbouring the highly prevalent c250t tert promoter mutations.   introduction the telomere sequences at the chromosomal ends, composed of tandem repeats of ttaggg, are protected by a number of molecules that constitute the capping shelterin complex [1 ;  2]. in those cases in which the neoplastic content was <50%, we microdissected the lesions to enrich the neoplastic content to >50%.  primers were designed to amplify the region containing the two tert mutations that were previously described—c228t and c250t—corresponding to the positions 124 and 146 bp, respectively, upstream of the tert atg start site (14, 15).  the pcr fragments were then purified and analyzed by conventional sanger sequencing.  in all, we evaluated tert promoter mutations in 1,230 tumor specimens and identified 231 mutations (%) (table 1).  c228t and c250t mutations accounted for % and % of the alterations, respectively (dataset s1).  additionally, we detected four mutations that had not been observed previously: three c228a mutations and one c229a mutation (dataset s1).  all four of these mutations as well as a representative subset of the c228t and c250t mutations (n = 59) were somatic, as evidenced by their absence in normal tissues of the patients containing the mutations in their tumors.   table 1. like astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas often progress, and they frequently contain tert promoter mutations (78% of 45 tumor samples) (table s3).  oligodendroglioma was the only tumor type studied (of all types, including non-cns tumors) (dataset s1) in which c250t mutations were nearly as frequent as c228t mutations.  in oligodendrogliomas, 43% of tumors with tert mutations contained c250t substitutions, whereas in other gliomas, only 10% did (p < , fisher exact probability test, two-tailed).
