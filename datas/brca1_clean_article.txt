(b) s1655f, t1700a, g1706e, v1713a, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, l1764p, and i1766s represent deleterious/high-risk variants; (c) variants r1443g, l1546n, l1564p, l1664p, v1804d, and p1806a do not represent high-risk variants, although we cannot rule out the possibility that they may represent moderate-risk variants; and (d) variant g1788d does not represent a neutral variant, although we cannot rule out the possibility that it may represent a moderate-risk variant instead of a deleterious one.  importantly, despite variation in levels in yeast and mammalian assays, no variant presented clearly conflicting results (>80% in one test and <40% in another). these results also highlight the difficulty in relying on limited pedigree data that may suggest cosegregation with the cancer phenotype (supplementary  s1).   we also did functional tests on 14 additional variants and functionally classified six (r1443g, v1534m, d1546n, e1644g, l1664p, and p1806a) as neutral and eight (s1655f, g1706e, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, l1764p, and i1766s) as deleterious ( 4).  the v1534m classification is supported by co-occurrence data (table 2) whereas the d1546n classification is supported by clinical data, specifically from family 230 (supplementary  s1) in which at least two affected women have been shown not to carry the variant.  structural analysis is consistent with the classification of all brct variants (s1655f, l1664p, g1706e, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, l1764p, i1766s, and p1806a; table 1).  however, caution should be exercised in the classification until further evidence for these thresholds is obtained.

2424 ||  among these six mutations, r1699w and r1699q replace a conserved residue involved in a salt bridge between the brct repeats (8) .  another one of the six mutations (g1743r) occurs at a position that is absolutely conserved among all available orthologs (supplementary  1).  for the remaining three exposed mutations that abolish transcription, we propose that they disrupt interactions with brca1 ligand(s).

the ring domain mutant, c64g; the c terminal mutant, p1749r; n terminal influenza hemagglutinin (ha)–tagged wild-type brca1; the ha-brca1 c terminal mutant, m1775r; the exon 11 mutant, t826k; and the ha-brca1 mutant, mfeδ, which is frameshifted at codon 1604 (figure 1b).  a viral vector carrying ires-gfp but no brca1 allele served as a negative control. once again, infected populations were sorted to contain approximately 90% gfp+ cells.  cultures synthesizing c64g, p1749r, m1775r, or t826k contained full-length (point mutant) brca1 proteins, the steady-state levels of which were similar to those of a wild-type brca1-expressing culture (figure 1c).  despite high expression levels of brca1 mfeδ in hcc1937 (as judged by the gfp signal), we were repeatedly unable to detect the expected ha-tagged protein product in vivo, using mabs capable of recognizing the in vitro–translated mfeδ product (data not shown). by contrast, cells synthesizing wild-type brca1 or ha-tagged wild-type brca1 showed, as before, a relative growth advantage in the irradiated mixed culture, but not in the unirradiated control (figure 3b and figure 3e).  gfp+ cells synthesizing brca1 p1749r, c64g, m1775r, t826k, or mfeδ failed to exhibit an ir-specific growth advantage after exposure to 4gy (figure 3c–3e).  therefore, reversal of the ir sensitivity phenotype by brca1 requires, at a minimum, an intact ring domain, brct motifs, and certain structures encoded by exon 11.

(d) comparison of induction of dsbs by 4gy ir in hcc1937/brca1 cells expressing the alleles shown.  values are the mean of duplicate samples, obtained in a separate experiment to that described in figure 4 in the same experiment, we examined the kinetics of dsbr in hcc1937-expressing brca1 missense mutant alleles that had failed to reverse γ sensitivity (brca1 p1749r, brca1 c64g, and brca1 t826k; see above).  hcc1937/brca1 p1749r, hcc1937/brca1 c64g, and hcc1937/brca1 t826k cells showed repair kinetics similar to those of hcc1937/gfp cells (figure 4a and figure 4b), indicating a failure by all to complement the dsbr defect of hcc1937. therefore, reconstitution with wild-type brca1 reduced the sensitivity of hcc1937 chromosomal dna to radiation-induced breakage.  by contrast, equivalent expression of two missense mutants (c64g and p1749r) failed to suppress effectively the “hypernickability” phenotype (figure 4d).  discussion hcc1937 represents a tool for investigating various functions of brca1.g. , c64g, t826k).  that this form of interallelic complementation was not observed suggests that, at a minimum, intact ring, brct, and exon 11–encoded regions must be present on one brca1 molecule for it to function in dsbr. plasmids and in vitro translation mutations in brca1 were generated as follows.  for the c64g mutant, wild-type brca1 in vector pcdna3β (scully  1997a) was used as template for pcr generation of the missense point mutant, c64g, using external pcr primers: 1, 5′-gggcccaagcttaccatggatttatctgctcttcg-3′;

 s6 b and c).    4. it was shown that the transcriptional activation assay could be used as a test to characterise mutations in the carboxy-terminus region of brca1 encompassing residues 1396–1863.  thirteen missense variants (h1402y, l1407p, h1421y, s1512i, m1628t, m1628v, t1685i, g1706a, t1720a, a1752p, g1788v, v1809f, and w1837r) were specifically investigated.  conclusions: while individual classification schemes for brca1 alleles still present limitations, a combination of several methods provides a more powerful way of identifying variants that are causally linked to a high risk of breast and ovarian cancer. along those lines, we hypothesised that unclassified missense variants located in regions of brca1 that contribute to transcription activation besides the brct domains might be amenable to a transcription based classification.  in the present study we show that the transcriptional activation assay can be used as a test to characterise mutations in the region encompassing aa 1396–1863 (exons 13 to 24) and we specifically investigated 13 missense variants (h1402y, l1407p, h1421y, s1512i, m1628t, m1628v, t1685i, g1706a, t1720a, a1752p, g1788v, v1809f, and w1837r).  in addition, we analysed all the mutations using a prediction algorithm based on interspecific sequence variation and grantham matrices.5 6 mutation h1402y was introduced by direct pcr using primers 24endt and h1402y-u (59 ggaattccagaggg ataccatgcaatataacc 39).  mutations l1407p, a1752p, and g1706a were introduced by the quickchange (stratagene) method according to the manufacturer’s instruction.  the following primers containing the alteration of interest were used for pcr involving the wild type constructs produced in a methylation competent bacterial strain, and amplification was carried out using pfu polymerase.  l1407p (l1407p-u, 59 ctgatcaagccccagca gg 39;

table 1). we then carried out an analysis using interspecific variation, pedigree analysis, and co-occurrence data (table 1).  of the seven variants for which the method based on interspecific variation was able to reach a conclusion, the data confirmed the classification based on our functional tests in six cases (l1407p, h1402y, t1685i, g1706a, g1788v, and w1837r) but presented a contradiction for variant m1628v.  the pedigree analysis confirmed our results for brca bilat 42 m brca 29 m brca 35 m brca 55 m prophylactic mastectomy lund 897 m = v1809f 1 brca 41 brca 66 brca 55 brca 44 wt m wt wt m brca 54 brca 51 cl-8 m = t1720a 3 brca 81 brca 85 wt f92 m = t1720a brca 55 brca 44 m brca 40 m wt brca 48 brca 49 ov 54 t334 m = m1628t brca 52 brca? 52 m wt wt m wt m m m m wt wt wt m 6-99-006 m = g1706a 2 brca65 br 44-54 brca 87 ov 45 brca 53 m792 m = w1837r othca 70 (colon?) prostate leukaemia? 78 m brca 40? sto cns? 42 brca 39 homcs 57 ovarian disgerminoma 27 m ovcs 58 bladder 53 wt brca 52 wt brca > 70? figure 3 pedigrees of missense variants in brca1. interestingly, results for g1706a suggested again that the available information is not enough to classify it.  while no conclusion can be drawn for variants that have very low frequency and are not found to co-occur with a deleterious mutation (for example, l1407p and h1421y), co-occurrence data indicated that h1402y, s1512, and m1628t do not represent high risk variants, confirming the functional assay results.  in order to further cross validate our analysis we compared it with results from three published methods to classify variants in the brct domain (table 1).  the first method is table 1 comprehensive analysis of brca1 variants exon mutation nucleotide change* allowed residues  txn` iv1 pdg ps** st   bic`` co11 comments 13 h1402y c4323t hdynk # # nd na na 1 1 reduces the probability to form coiled coil   structure from  to  13 l1407p t4339c l n ? nd na na 1 0 conserved stretch;

however, given that fact that pedigree analysis, transcriptional activation, and protease sensitivity indicate a high risk variant, our conclusion is that, although the change is a conservative one, the side chain size threshold in the algorithm needs to be refined.  in summary, we have classified six missense variants (l1407p, m1628v, t1685i, a1752p, g1788v, and v1809f) as probable deleterious/high risk variants and the remainder as probable neutral/low clinical significance variants (h1402y, h1421y, s1512i, m1628t, and t1720a), with two variants (g1706a and w1837r) left unclassified.  previously, all the known deleterious missense changes were in the ring domain or brct repeats. although further work is needed to classify variants l1407p and m1628v unambiguously, our results provide evidence that other regions or motifs are likely to harbour high risk missense substitutions.  in particular, classification of l1407p as a high risk variant suggests an important function for the putative coiled coil motif as previously suggested. 31 57 the 4-3 spacing of hydrophobic residues in the coiled coil is clearly evolutionarily conserved through the puffer fish brca1 sequence (tetraodon, accession ay428536).
2432 ||  for the remaining three exposed mutations that abolish transcription, we propose that they disrupt interactions with brca1 ligand(s).  they are located in a groove formed by both brct repeats (l1657p and k1702e) and in the ridge that delimits the groove (e1660g).  we suggest that this clustering of residues in a single patch on the surface of brca1 highlights a binding site with integrity that is necessary for transcription.

2435 ||  although still far from clinical application, these methods have provided important information.   here we apply a transcription-based assay to assess the effect of 22 variants (r1443g, v1534m, d1546n, l1564p, p1614s, e1644g, s1655f, l1664p, t1700a, g1706e, v1713a, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, i1766s, l1764p, q1785h, g1788d, e1794d, v1804d, and p1806a) on the activity of the brca1 cooh terminus (amino acids 1,396–1,863) and interpret the findings in light of all available clinical, genetic, and structural information.  these ucvs were found in individuals from families with breast or ovarian cancer in which no other deleterious mutation in brca1 or brca2 was found, and thus it is not clear whether they are causally related to disease.  go to: materials and methods constructs  control constructs containing the wild-type (wt) brca1, s1613g, m1775r, and y1853x were previously described (12).  mutations r1443g, v1534m, d1546n, l1564p, p1614s, e1644g, s1655f, l1664p, t1700a, g1706e, v1713a, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, i1766s, l1764p, q1785h, g1788d, e1794d, v1804d, and p1806a were introduced by splicing by overlapping extension pcr (20) using plasmid p385-brca1 as template.  primers sequences are available on request. gray boxes, brct domains; dbd, gal4 dna binding domain.  six variants (r1443g, v1534m, d1546n, l1564p, p1614s, and e1644g) that lie upstream of the brctdomains were investigated for their effect on transcription ( 2).  this region displays relatively low conservation across other brca1 orthologues with no recognizable structural motif and was therefore expected to be more tolerant to changes (32). variants r1443g, p1614s, and e1644g showed transcription activation levels equal or higher than wt brca1 whereas v1534m, d1546n, and l1564p had lower activity (between 60% and 80% of the wt activity) in yeast ( 2a).  in mammalian cells, variants v1534m, d1546n, p1614s, and e1644g showed transcription activation activity comparable to wt (within  sd) whereas variants r1443g and l1564p had reduced activity (∼55% of wt;  2b).   figure 2 figure 2 functional analysis of missense variants in brca1. therefore, the loh analyses from these two individuals are not conclusive.   d1546n in family 230, four individuals were tested and two women with early-onset breast cancer do not carry the variant.  however, it is possible that the variant derives from the mother's side of the family and the information from the father's side of the family is not relevant to conclude the absence of segregation. these results also highlight the difficulty in relying on limited pedigree data that may suggest cosegregation with the cancer phenotype (supplementary  s1).   we also did functional tests on 14 additional variants and functionally classified six (r1443g, v1534m, d1546n, e1644g, l1664p, and p1806a) as neutral and eight (s1655f, g1706e, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, l1764p, and i1766s) as deleterious ( 4).  the v1534m classification is supported by co-occurrence data (table 2) whereas the d1546n classification is supported by clinical data, specifically from family 230 (supplementary  s1) in which at least two affected women have been shown not to carry the variant.
2437 ||  however, the brca1:e2 interaction was also sensitive to non-e2 interface substitutions present within loops forming the cross-brace structure of the ring ( 3d), at the join between the ring domain and flanking helices ( 3f), as well as within the flanking helices ( 3g).  substitutions that did not inhibit the e2 interaction are conservative in their nature (v11a, i15l, i21v, i42v, l87v), away from the e2 interface (d67e/y, r71g, k38n) or in the distal portions of the a-helices (s4p, r7c, i90t, d96n, g98r and also y105c, i124v and p142h (data not shown)) (illustrated in supplementary material,  s4).  thus the locations and type of the majority of e2 disruptive variants figure 3.
2439 ||  the embryonic lethality encountered in the knockout mouse initially hindered the development of mouse models aimed at studying tumor suppression.  however, mice that harbor hypomorphic brca1 and brca2 alleles and cre-mediated tissue-specific deletions for brca1 and brca2 have been generated.  mice deficient for either brca1 or brca2 sustain a wide range of carcinoma and mammary epithelium deleted for brca1 or brca2 is highly susceptible to mammary tumorigenesis. tumor latency and life span were decreased in the homozygous double knockout as compared to p53-/- mice.  interestingly, post-natal viability was accomplished in the brca1delta11/delta11 mice by brca1 cre-mediated deletion in germ cells by crossing brca1flox11 mice with eiia-cre mice (xu , 2001b).  the cre-mediated brca1delta11/delta11 deleted mice had 1% viability; however, further details regarding the life span and development of the few animals that survived were not reported.  tumorigenesis in conditional brca1 and brca2 mutations  several mouse models have been created which mutate either brca1 or brca2 by cre-mediated recombination in specific tissues.  brca1 and brca2 deletion restricted to mammary epithelium was achieved using the highly restricted wap (whey acidic protein) promoter and the somewhat less specific mmtv-ltr (mouse mammary tumor virus-long terminal repeat) to direct expression of cre (ludwig , 2001b; xu , 1999a).  in addition, mouse models with tissue-restricted cre-mediated deletion of brca1 in thymocytes directed by the lck promoter and of brca2 exon 11 in epithelium directed by the human keratin 14 (k14) gene promoter were generated (jonkers , 2001; mak , 2000) (table 3). however, mammary tumorigenesis in the k14cre/brca2f11/f11 mice was dependent on the loss of p53 (jonkers , 2001).  an important feature to keep in mind in these conditional animal models is that cre-mediated deletion of brca1 or brca2 is dependent on the activity of the promoter that is driving cre expression and can be quite variable.  in addition, cre-mediated deletion is active only in the mammary epithelial cells and not in surrounding stromal tissue.  analysis of mammary gland development in the brca1ko/co/mmtv-cre mice during pregnancy revealed incomplete ductal and alveolar development, with incomplete fat pad filling and increased apoptosis.  the magnitude of the developmental defect was correlated to the amount of cre-mediated deletion, whereas those glands that had extensive apoptosis and filling of less than 50% of the fat pad had transcripts that were reduced by 60-80%.  surprisingly, mothers were able to nurse their litters (xu , 1999a).  the first mouse model to directly demonstrate the tumor suppressor activity of brca1 was reported by xu , with the creation of the brca1ko/co/mmtv-cre and brca1ko/co/wap-cre mice which deletes exon 11 upon cre expression in mammary epithelium (xu , 1999a).  as noted above, this deletion can be alternatively spliced, resulting in expression of an exon 11 deleted brca1 product.  the initial report on a small number of mice was notable for five mammary tumors occurring in 23 mice at a latency of 10-13 months.  molecular analysis of the tumors revealed reduced intensity of the unrecombined brca1 allele, suggesting that most of the cells had undergone cre-mediated deletion.  analysis of additional mice was reported in a follow-up study, confirming an incidence of mammary tumorigenesis of 25% in 150 mice followed over a 2-year period with an average tumor latency of 11 months (brodie , 2001). analysis of the sacrificed mice revealed significant tumor multifocality, with 10 of the 20 mice having 2-4 tumors (ludwig , 2001b).   a second conditional mutation was created by cre-mediated deletion of brca2 exon 11 (jonkers , 2001).  the predicted brca2 product would be devoid of the rad51 interacting brc domains in exon 11 but should retain n-terminal and c-terminal sequences that may possess other functional domains, such as dna binding (yang , 2002).  confirmation that both p53 and brca2 are tumor suppressors for breast cancer was shown by molecular analysis of the 21 brca2f11/f11/p53f2-10/f2-10 mammary tumors.  all four conditional alleles had undergone cre-mediated deletion.  however, in the brca2f11/+/p53f2-10/f2-10 mammary tumors, several had lost the wild-type and conditionally deleted brca2 alleles, but nearly half had retained both alleles. squamous cell carcinoma of skin was frequently observed, as were rare salivary gland tumors.  in the lck-cre/brca1f5-6 t-cell specific deletion, a predisposition to thymoma was observed (hakem and mak, 2001).    pathology of brca-associated mouse mammary tumors  several reports that have documented an increased predisposition to cancer in the brca-deficient mouse models have provided detailed pathologic descriptions, assessments of genomic instability, and analysis of genes commonly associated with human breast cancers. unlike brca1-associated mouse mammary tumors, the brca2-associated tumors were much less heterogenous.  the brca2flox conditional mammary deletion gave rise to grossly palpable tumors, with only two histological patterns (solid carcinoma and adenosquamous carcinoma), with an occasional tumor containing both types (ludwig , 2001b).  the tumor cells were uniform with mild nuclear pleomorphism, with the exception of two tumors that had significant nuclear atypia. seven tumors (5-brca1ko/co and 2-p53+/-/brca1ko/co) were analysed, six at early passage number.  all the tumors displayed numerical and structural chromosome aberrations, including chromatid and chromosome breaks, insertions, deletions, and re-arrangements.  two were largely clonal, whereas other tumors had different degrees of multiclonality, indicating ongoing genomic instability. in finland, mutations in these genes explain approximately 20% of breast and ovarian cancer families [1, 2].  most of the alterations identified in brca1 and brca2 are point mutations and small insertions/deletions, but increasing number of large genomic rearrangements in both genes have been identified in different populations [3, 4, 5, 6].  rearrangements have been described throughout the genes, and majority of them are unique and introduce a premature termination codon in the reading frame [3, 6]. here, we wanted to investigate whether large genomic rearrangements in palb2 could also explain some of the finnish breast and/or ovarian cancer families. in the current study we have used multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (mlpa) in order to identify exon deletions and duplications in the brca1, brca2 and palb2 genes.  mlpa has been proven to be very useful in detecting copy number changes in genomic sequences [19]. after pcr amplification with ird800 labeled primers the samples were analyzed with li-cor ir2 4200-s dna analysis system (li-cor , lincoln, ne) and gene profiler  analysis program (scanalytics, , fairfax, va).  for brca1 analysis the used deletion control had deletions in exons 1a-2, for brca2 analysis the control sample showed constant 50% reduction in band intensity resulting from a snp locating three base pairs from the ligation site, and for palb2 analysis the used control had heterozygous deletions in exons 1–3 and 5–10 in addition to homozygous deletion of exon 4. the information regarding the integrated density of each band received from geneprofiler was analyzed by mlpa spreadsheets (national genetics reference laboratory) in excel software according to the instructions.resultswe have analyzed a total of 61 index patients for large genomic rearrangements in brca1, brca2 and palb2 genes by mlpa.  in brca2 and palb2 no deletions or duplications were observed.  we did, however, observe one large deletion in brca1 (exon 1a-13) (figure 1), deleting the most part of the gene, including the promoter region.  this deletion spans over 43 kb.  the initial observation with p002b kit was subsequently confirmed by the brca1 confirmation kit p087.  the patient carrying the deletion allele was diagnosed with ovarian cancer at the age of 49 years.  the family had strong history of cancer, and there were altogether three cases of ovarian cancer (figure 2).figure 1mlpa analysis of a patient with family history of ovarian cancer.  a large genomic deletion of exons 1a to 13 in brca1 was found.  y-axis dosage quotients, x-axis used control probes (blue) and individual brca1 exons (green). figure 2family exhibiting exon 1a-13 deletion in brca1 .  index case is shown with an arrow. for palb2 this is the first study designed to detect large genomic rearrangements in the finnish population. the index cases of 61 families included in this study were analyzed for rearrangements in the three genes by mlpa, and in one family we identified a large deletion in brca1.  the observed deletion removes most of the gene including the promoter [21], thereby preventing the transcription of brca1. the mutation positive patient displayed a family history of ovarian cancer, which has been shown to increase the likelihood of finding a brca1 mutation in a family [22].  deletions that remove the brca1 promoter have previously been described, but the earlier studies have not associated these changes with any particular phenotype [23, 24, 25, 26].  our result provide the first evidence that, like in many other studied populations, large genomic changes in brca1 do also exist in finland.  however, these mutations seem to be rare, if not unique, as this deletion was seen in only one out of 61 families. to date, only three different brca1 mutations have been identified in northern finnish breast and/or ovarian cancer families. two of these mutations, 3745delt and 4216-2nta>g, represent recurrent finnish founder mutations [1, 2, 27], accounting for three mutation positive families each [2].  the third brca1 mutation is the currently identified large deletion of exons 1a-13, which represents % (1/7) of the identified northern finnish brca1 positive families.  even though the deletion allele was observed only in one out 61 currently analyzed families, our results suggests that women eligible for brca1 or brca2 mutation screening, when found negative, could benefit from screening for large genomic rearrangements, at least in brca1. additional work is still needed in order to determine the prevalence of brca2 rearrangements in finland, as the current study was based only on relatively small number of families. despite the identification of one large genomic deletion in brca1, our results support the previous conclusions that the genomic rearrangements in brca1 and brca2 are not a major cause for increased breast cancer susceptibility in finland, and that the previously reported finnish founder mutations represent the majority of brca1 and brca2 positive families [1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 27].  no exon deletions or duplications of the palb2 gene were identified in the studied index cases of 61 families. to model endogenous alkylating damage, we determined the mutation spectrum caused by methyl methanesulfonate (mms), and showed that mms also induces more base substitution mutations in brca1/2-deficient cells.  spontaneously arising and mms-induced insertion/deletion mutations and large rearrangements were also more common in brca1/2 mutant cells compared with the wild-type control.  a difference in the short deletion phenotypes of brca1 and brca2 suggested distinct roles for the two proteins in the processing of dna lesions, as brca2 mutants contained more short deletions, with a wider size distribution, which frequently showed microhomology near the breakpoints resembling repair by non-homologous end joining.17 a similar mechanism may give rise to dsbs in untreated cells, explaining the essential function of rad51 following dna replication. 18  incorrect repair of dsbs is expected to result in short deletions and structural rearrangements, as observed in brca1/2-deficient cells, but it is not known whether brca1 or brca2 influences the generation of base substitution mutations by various dna adducts.  through the genome sequence analysis of mock-treated and mms-treated chicken dt40 cell clones we show that brca1 or brca2 deficiency strongly and indistinguishably increases the level of spontaneously arising base changes with a mutation spectrum very similar to that observed in brca1/2-deficient cancer, and also increases mutagenesis induced by high doses of mutagens.  the number of insertion/deletion (indel) mutations and rearrangements is also higher in hr mutants, with important differences between brca1 and brca2, suggesting that point mutations and indels are generated by different mechanisms in hr-deficient cells.   top of page results loss of brca1 or brca2 increases the spontaneous mutation rate we set out to determine the quantity and map the profile of spontaneous mutations arising in wild-type (wt) and brca1 or brca2 mutant cells.22 we tuned isomut to detect maximum five false-positive single-nucleotide variations (snvs) per starting clone (table 1).   table 1 - number of snv and short insertion/deletion mutations in the sequenced samples.  table 1 - number of snv and short insertion/deletion mutations in the sequenced samples - unfortunately we are unable to provide accessible alternative text for this. this result suggests that the mms-induced mutations in the wt, and the identical mms mutation spectrum in the brca1 and brca2 mutants is indeed shaped by the process of tls.   the analysis of short insertions and deletions reveals differences between brca1- and brca2-associated mutagenesis brca mutations have been associated with the increased appearance of indels in tumour genomes. 34 we used the isomut mutation detection method to identify short indels up to 50 b22 in wt mock-treated samples we found ± (s.d. ) spontaneously arising insertions and ± deletions per genome (table 1, figures 4a and b).  in contrast, genomes of brca1−/− mock-treated samples contained ± short insertions and ± deletions, a significant increase in each mutation category (p= and p<, respectively) and altogether a fourfold increase in indels compared with the wt.  brca2−/− mock-treated samples contained eight times more indels than the wt, with a significant increase in both the number of insertions (±, p=) and deletions (±, p<).  there was no significant difference between the numbers of spontaneous short indels in the wt sample and the brca1+/− and brca2+/− heterozygotes (figures 4a and b).  mms treatment further increased the number of deletions in all investigated cell lines, while it had no

indicated (unpaired t-test, *p<, **p<, ***p<).   full figure and legend (198k)  to better understand the processes generating insertions and deletions, we examined the length distribution and sequence context of indels.  in the wt and the brca1/2 heterozygous lines most indels were one-base long. in contrast, we found a distinct length pattern in each brca mutant cell line.  in brca1−/− cells, 1 bp and over 10 bp long deletions were most common, whereas in brca2−/− there was a significantly different, broader distribution of various indel lengths (figure 4d, p=, kolmogorov–smirnov test).  mms treatment typically doubled the number of deletions, but maintained the difference between brca1−/−- and brca2−/−-specific indel length distributions (p=, kolmogorov–smirnov test), suggesting that similar processes cause indels at spontaneous or mms-derived dna lesions. there were significantly more deletions in brca2−/− samples than in brca1−/− samples (p= and p= in mock- and mms-treated samples, respectively, figure 2b).  we classified deletions according to their sequence context.  in general, there was an increase in all categories in the brca1/2 mutants compared with the wt, but the distribution of the deletions between the three applied categories was also significantly different (p= and p= for mock-treated and mms-treated samples, respectively, fisher’s exact test). most notable was the increase (fivefold in mock-treated and threefold in mms-treated samples) in brca2−/− mutants in deletions displaying evidence of microhomology, that is, partial repetition of 1–5 bases at the end of these deletions (figure 3c).  such short microhomologies at deletions are likely evidence of dna double-strand break repair by nhej, particularly its microhomology-mediated variety. 35 taken together, the greater increase in deletion numbers, the broader range of deletion length and the higher proportion of microhomology-derived deletions suggest that certain dna lesions in the absence of brca2 are frequently repaired by nhej, whereas in the absence of brca1 these lesions may have alternative modes of repair.  what could be the cause of the elevated mutation rate of brca1 and brca2 mutant cells? note that although the snv patterns in the brca1 and brca2 mutant cell lines were identical, there were both qualitative and quantitative differences in the arising indels, suggesting that snvs and indels arise via different mechanisms.  deletions may mainly arise at collapsed replication forks, and the brca2 deletion phenotype fully agrees with nhej acting on double-strand breaks unrepaired by hr.  the milder brca1 deletion phenotype suggests a decision point between the action of brca1 and brca2 in the process of fork collapse such that in the absence of brca2 mutagenic nhej is unavoidable, whereas in the absence of brca1 alternative dna bypass mechanisms can still operate. considering the identical snv phenotypes but distinct indel phenotypes of brca1 and brca2 mutant cell lines, a high snv mutation rate may also be an important cause of the oncogenic effect of the loss of brca1 or brca2 function.   we applied a novel method to detect single or multiple exon deletions and amplifications in the brca1 gene.  the test, called multiplex ligationdependent probe amplification (mlpa), uses probes designed to hybridize adjacently to the target sequence. our two diagnostic laboratories have tested in the recent years 805 families by conventional pcr-based techniques, and found 116 brca1 and 28 brca2 mutation-positive families.  using mlpa, we have tested the remaining 661 noninformative breast cancer families and identified five distinct brca1 germ-line mutations in five families: a deletion of exon 8, a deletion of exons 20–22, a duplication of exon 13 and exons 21–23, respectively, and a triplication, encompassing exons 17–19.  genomic deletions of brca1 constitute a substantial fraction of mutations in dutch breast cancer families.  if mlpa had been included in our initial brca1 testing, 33 families with a deletion or duplication would have been identified, representing 27% of the total 121 brca1 mutation-positive families.  the mlpa test for brca1 ensures a sensitive and comprehensive high-throughput screening test for genomic rearrangement and can easily be implemented in the molecular analysis of brca1. introduction germ-line mutations in the brca1 gene cause a hereditary predisposition to breast and ovarian cancer.  methods used to screen for mutations focus on genomic dna and are usually pcr-based, enabling the detection of sequence alterations such as point mutations, and small deletions and insertions.  by this approach, thousands of brca1 families have been identified worldwide (the breast cancer information core on the internet).2 an increasing number of large genomic alterations have been described recently as laboratories put more effort into the detection of such alterations.  at present,  18 different large genomic rearrangements have been characterized; they include both deletions and duplications of one or more exons in brca1 (1–6).  although for some recurrent mutations a simple pcr test has been developed (4, 5), the gold standard to search for aberrant copy numbers of one or more exons is southern blotting. however, this technique is time consuming and laborious and, therefore, screening is usually restricted to selected families (1–4, 7, 8).  ideally, all of the individuals eligible for brca1 mutation screening should be screened for the presence of large genomic deletions and duplications.  therefore, we applied a new method, called mlpa,3 which enables us to determine the relative copy number of all of the brca1 exons simultaneously with high sensitivity in a high-throughput format (9).  we have shown recently that this method is very successful in the identification of large genomic deletions in the hmlh1 and hmsh2 genes in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal carcinoma families (10).  the principle of this technique is shown in  1. primers for the exon 13 duplication were described by puget  (5).  for the newly discovered deletion of exons 8 and 20–22, primers were designed located in the flanking introns.  the primer combination for the exon 8 deletion is: forward primer (nt 27164; genbank accession no. l78833) 5-gttgggcttttaaatactcgttcc-3 and reverse primer (nt 29530) 5-cctattgctactctccatctttcc-3.  the deletion of exons 20–22 could be detected using forward primer (nt 67911) 5agataggccaatgttggtcg- 3 and reverse primer (nt 81183) 5-actgtgctactcaagcacca-3.  the recombination site was sequenced using forward primer (nt 68664) 5-gctgggaatggtggcatgtg-3. the mlpa analysis of 90 control samples yielded highly reproducible results, both for brca1 and non-brca1 probes ( 2, top panels).  the limited variation allows an accurate discrimination between carriers of deletions and duplications or noncarriers.  to test the sensitivity and specificity of the brca1-mlpa, we  3.org on may 29, 2017.  © 2003 american association for cancer used samples from known brca1 mutation carriers of a deletion of exon 13 or 22, both of which are found frequently in the dutch population, or a mutation located at the ligation site of the exon 14 probes (4535delttinsg).  the genescan electrophorerograms of the exon 13 deletion showed a clear reduction of the fluorescence signal of this exon compared with a normal control sample (data not shown).  similar results were obtained for the exon 22 deletion and the exon 14 ligation site mutation.  after quantification, the reduction of the relative copy numbers for exons 13, 14, or 22 ( 2, bottom panels) was estimated to be 40–50%, which results in a relative copy number of one for the exons involved. among 805 families tested between 1995 and 2001 in our two diagnostic laboratories (netherlands cancer institute and vu university medical center) a mutation with a predicted pathogenic effect was identified in 144 families, using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, denaturing high performance liquid chromatography, protein truncation test, or mutation-specific tests.  a brca1 mutation was detected in 116 families, 28 families of which with a deletion of exon 13 or 22.  a brca2 mutation was found in 28 families. using mlpa, we have screened the remaining 661 families (843 individuals) and detected 5 families with aberrant exon copy numbers ( 3).  two novel deletions were identified: a deletion of exon 8 in case 596 and a deletion of the exons 20–22 in case 210.  in addition, two duplications were found: a duplication of exon 13 (case 465) and a novel duplication of exons 21–23 (case 121). 5; data not shown).  for the novel deletions, we used various combinations of pcr primers to obtain a junction fragment for sequence analysis.  we found that the exon 8 deletion in case 596 starts at position ivs7–1129 and comprises 1458 bp including exon 8.  the deletion of exons 20, 21, and 22 starts at position ivs19–2840 and comprises 11,395 nt.  southern blotting was used to investigate the amplifications of exons 21–23 and 17–19 ( 4a). because  40% of the brca1 genomic sequence consists of alu repeats it is not surprising that all five of the genomic breakpoints are located in alu elements and, thus, are likely caused by alu recombination (14).  mlpa testing of 661 families with a previously negative test result during regular screening yielded two deletions and three duplications, of which four were novel.  because these mutations occurred only once, it is unlikely that in addition to the exon 13 and exon 22 deletion founder mutations, another high frequency exon copy number mutation is present in the dutch population.  furthermore, if mlpa had been used as the initial screening technique, 33 families with a deletion or duplication in brca1 would have been identified, representing 27% of the total 121 pathogenic brca1 mutations.  in parallel to the dutch situation, the fraction of mutations missed by direct sequencing or other mutation detection methods based on pcr amplification of small fragments could be high in any population.org on may 29, 2017.  © 2003 american association for cancer presence of large genomic deletions and duplications.  and, therefore, we consider the brca1-mlpa test a major improvement on the current diagnostic testing for hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer  to date, more than 300 distinct small deletions, insertions and point mutations, mostly leading to premature termination of translation, have been reported in the breast/ovarian-cancer susceptibility gene brca1. here we report that the currently available mutation spectrum of brca1 has been biased by pcr-based mutation-screening methods, such as sscp, the protein truncation test (ptt) and direct sequencing, using genomic dna as template.  three large genomic deletions that are not detected by these approaches comprise 36% of all brca1 mutations found in dutch breast-cancer families to date.  a 510-bp alu-mediated deletion comprising exon 22 was found in 8 of 170 breast-cancer families recruited for research purposes and in 6 of 49 probands referred to the amsterdam family cancer clinic for genetic counselling. in addition, a 3,835-bp alu-mediated deletion encompassing exon 13 was detected in 4 of 170 research families, while an deletion of approximately 14 kb was detected in a single family [corrected].  haplotype analyses indicated that each recurrent deletion had a single common ancestor. 
2441 ||  three of them are exposed on the face away from the putative binding site proposed above, whereas the remaining five mutations are conservative changes in the core of the fold (table 1 ⇓ ;  2 ⇓ ).  five mutations (g1706a, s1715n, f1761i, m1775v, and a1843t) in the total set of 37, with impact on the transcriptional activation function that is known, could not be readily explained.  possible reasons for the inability to explain these mutants are discussed in detail in supplementary table 3. even conservative mutations may not be well-accepted in residues that are perfectly conserved in all species.  this is illustrated by mutation f1761i where a smaller hydrophobic residue is not tolerated in place of a bulkier one.  loss-of-function mutations were located primarily in the brct domains.

the variant 5416t4g (5295t4g, i1766s) has been classified as deleterious mutation by other studies [carvalho , 2007].  three have been previously reported as probably neutral: the 655a4g (536a4g, y179c) has been reported by judkins  [2005]; the 1767a4c (1648a4c, n550 h) was classified as probably neutral by tavtigian  [2006]; and the 515c4a (396c4a, n132 k) has been reported as likely to be of no or little clinical significance by easton  [2007].  finally, the variant 4654g4t (4535g4t, s1512i) was reported as neutral by deffenbaugh  [2002] and confirmed by tavtigian  [2006]. the location of selected missense variants and negative and positive controls is depicted in figure 1.  each selected variant was found in a single family with the exception of the three variants, y179c, f486l, and n550 h, which were found to be associated in two unrelated families.  the control variants c61g, a1708e, and m1775r were not found in the breast and ovarian cancer family group we studied. the segregation analysis of the variant allele with the disease was performed only in families pi403, pi397, pi258, and pi222, for which dna samples of unaffected or affected relatives were available.  the variants y179c and n550 h were both detected in two unrelated families, families pi403 and pi340, in which the neutral variant f486l has also been found.  the proband from family pi403 was affected by breast cancer at 42 years of age. loh was not observed in the tumor dna of the n132 k carrier in family pi432.  the wild-type allele was lost in the tumor dna of the proband of family pi340 carrying the three variants y179c, f486l, and n550 h.  the tumor dna of both patients carrying the variant a1789 t showed no loh of the wild-type allele but the methylation profile of brca1 gene promoter of both samples showed hypermethylation. the underlying assumption is that inheritance of a genuine high-risk missense substitution in brca1, along with a clearly deleterious table 1.  description of the brca1 missense variants analyzed brca1 varianta systematic nomenclatureb number of families harboring the variant siftc polyphend bice pathogenicity previous classification 477g4a, d120n 358g4a 1   0 null not classified 515c4a, n132k 396c4a 1 0  1 damaging neutral [easton , 2007] 655a4g, y179cf 536a4g 2   35 damaging probably neutral [judkins , 2005] 1118a4g, t333a 999a4g 1   0 null not classified 1575t4c, f486lf 1456t4c 2   37 null neutral [judkins , 2005] 1767a4c, n550hf 1648a4c 2   35 probably deleterious probably neutral [judkins , 2005] 2576t4c, s819p 2457t4c 1   0 null not classified 3147c4t, p1010s 3028c4t 1   0 null not classified 3610g4t, s1164i 3491g4t 1   0 damaging not classified 4654g4t, s1512i 4535g4t 2   50 damaging neutral [tavtigian , 2006] 5075g4a, m1652i 4956g4a 4   39 probably neutral neutral tavtigian , 2006] 5416t4g, i1766s 5295t4g 1   5 damaging deleterious [carvalho , 2007] 5484g4a, a1789t 5365g4a 1   0 probably deleterious not classified a dna mutation nomenclature is as used in the bic database (http://research. nhgri.gov/bic/) revised in january 2006.  f both patients with the y179c variant also carried the f486l and the n550h variants.  126 human mutation, vol. the colonies from the brca1-expressing strain contained an average of 7,000 cells per colony;

2455 ||  we have also described eight of the variants as of “moderate functional effect” in which a preponderance of the data points to a loss of function.  these include variants with intermediate levels of peptide binding specificity (w1837g and a1843p) or transcriptional activity (v1696l, g1706e, and h1746n), and strong defects in all of the other assays.  in addition, we have included three additional mutants in this group that show poor agreement between the different assays but are likely to directly affect the peptide-binding surface.
2456 ||  [21]), but this had only a very minor effect on nuclear localization.  by contrast, five different brca1 constructs (p1749r, m1775r, y1853x, 5382insc and δ1751) that contain single amino acid mutations or short deletions (including removal of only the last 11 amino acids in y1853x) within the c-terminal tandem brct domains, shifted brca1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm ( 1).  similar results were observed in t47d breast cancer cells, for both untagged and yellow fluorescent protein (yfp)-tagged versions of these constructs (data not shown). as we recently observed in cells exposed to methyl methanesulfonate (34), the brct-truncated mutant brca1–5382insc failed to cluster in nuclear foci before or after ir-induced dna damage ( 2).  similarly, three other frequently studied c-terminal brct mutants, p1749r, m1775r, and y1853x, all displayed a dramatic decrease in foci localization compared with the wild-type protein.  in contrast, the n-terminal ring domain mutant c61g, which is defective for ubiquitin ligase activity (8), was only modestly reduced in its overall ability to form foci and still exhibited a potent response to ir treatment (59% of cells with >10 foci). the brct mutation in hcc1937 cells correlates with defects in g1 checkpoint activation and hyper-sensitivity to dna damage agents (21) and aberrant chromosome structure (47).  certain brca1 mutations, such as p1749r and y1853x, alter the stability and folding of the brct domain, which would interfere with brca1 binding to specific partners (48, 49).  other brct mutations such as m1775r affect surface residues but not the protein structure, thereby reducing binding affinity to bach1 (49–51). pools of ecor+ cells were infected, in parallel, with retroviruses encoding wild-type and various mutant brca1 products.  the relevant products included: wild-type brca1; the ring domain mutant, c64g; the c terminal mutant, p1749r; n terminal influenza hemagglutinin (ha)–tagged wild-type brca1; the ha-brca1 c terminal mutant, m1775r; the exon 11 mutant, t826k; and the ha-brca1 mutant, mfeδ, which is frameshifted at codon 1604 (figure 1b).  a viral vector carrying ires-gfp but no brca1 allele served as a negative control. once again, infected populations were sorted to contain approximately 90% gfp+ cells.  cultures synthesizing c64g, p1749r, m1775r, or t826k contained full-length (point mutant) brca1 proteins, the steady-state levels of which were similar to those of a wild-type brca1-expressing culture (figure 1c).  despite high expression levels of brca1 mfeδ in hcc1937 (as judged by the gfp signal), we were repeatedly unable to detect the expected ha-tagged protein product in vivo, using mabs capable of recognizing the in vitro–translated mfeδ product (data not shown). by contrast, cells synthesizing wild-type brca1 or ha-tagged wild-type brca1 showed, as before, a relative growth advantage in the irradiated mixed culture, but not in the unirradiated control (figure 3b and figure 3e).  gfp+ cells synthesizing brca1 p1749r, c64g, m1775r, t826k, or mfeδ failed to exhibit an ir-specific growth advantage after exposure to 4gy (figure 3c–3e).  therefore, reversal of the ir sensitivity phenotype by brca1 requires, at a minimum, an intact ring domain, brct motifs, and certain structures encoded by exon 11.

see above).  hcc1937/brca1 p1749r, hcc1937/brca1 c64g, and hcc1937/brca1 t826k cells showed repair kinetics similar to those of hcc1937/gfp cells (figure 4a and figure 4b), indicating a failure by all to complement the dsbr defect of hcc1937. therefore, reconstitution with wild-type brca1 reduced the sensitivity of hcc1937 chromosomal dna to radiation-induced breakage.  by contrast, equivalent expression of two missense mutants (c64g and p1749r) failed to suppress effectively the “hypernickability” phenotype (figure 4d).  discussion hcc1937 represents a tool for investigating various functions of brca1. the product of the triple ligation was tested for presence of a new avrii site (underlined in pcr product 2), and the pcr region confirmed to be correct by sequencing.  the p1749r and m1775r mutants were kindly supplied by dr.  fergus couch;

coyne , 2004; humphrey , 1997].  our results were consistent with these previous studies.  a1708e and y1853x cells formed colonies almost equal in size to vector cells, p1749r and m1775r cells displayed an intermediate phenotype, and m1652i cells were similar to brca1 cells ( 3b).  these results indicate that our assay behaves similarly to those employed by other laboratories., δ(1300–1863) in  1c).  a mild but significant decrease of cells showing one spot was also observed for m18t, e33a, c44y, p1749r, and m1775r mutations.  we therefore conclude first that the ylp assay is efficient in assessing missense mutations located in nter and cter ends of brca1. two arguments support this notion.  first, most of the deleterious mutations located in brct, including a1708e, p1749r, and m1775r, disturb the correct folding of these domains [lee , 2010; williams , 2003].  second, the western blot results, observed for δ(1–66), δ(1755–1863), a1708e, and y1853x ( 2a and b), suggest a link between the slightly increased amount of lower molecular weight bands and the delocalized aggregation into the cytoplasm. second, the deletion of the last 113 amino acids (δ(1751–1863) construct) induces a cytoplasmic mislocalization of the protein in human cells while more extensive cter deletions do not [rodriguez , 2004].  lastly, p1749r, m1775r and y1853x impair formation of nuclear foci [au and henderson, 2005], with a strong cytoplasmic mislocalization for y1853x [nelson and holt, 2010; rodriguez , 2004].  all these observations are surprisingly recapitulated in yeast, which validate the ylp assay. yeast transformed by pad–brca1–δ2 modified by a1708e, a missense mutation predisposing to cancer (23), formed large colonies equal in size to vector controls ( (33 b and c).  two other mutations, m1775r (6, 23) and p1749r (24), each partially inactivated the growth inhibitory function of pad–brca1–δ2 ( (3,3, b and c).  the results correlate with published data that a1708e, m1775r, and p1749r abrogate the transcriptional activity of brca1 fusion proteins in other assays (12, 13). however, the mutation alters a residue that is isoleucine in murine brca1, and no other cancer-affected relatives were available to verify segregation of the v1713a sequence change with disease, creating ambiguity about the relationship between v1713a and cancer predisposition.  in this assay, yeast transformed with pad–brca1–δ2 modified by v1713a formed easily visible colonies comparable in size and number of cells per colony to m1775r and p1749r cancer-predisposing controls ( (33c), suggesting that v1713a inactivates a function that protects against cancer and is consistent with detection of this sequence change in the germline of an individual with a high probability of hereditary breast–ovarian cancer.   p1637l, like v1713a, was detected in the germline and tumor dna of an individual with early onset ovarian cancer from a family with a history of breast and ovarian cancer (23). hf7c transformed by pbd–brca1 modified by y1853x did not grow on plates lacking histidine, consistent with the link of this mutation to cancer (21), results in our growth assay, and published results (13).   p1749r is a cancer-associated mutation that was discovered in the germline of an ovarian cancer family (24), that alters a conserved residue (8), and that inactivated growth inhibition by pad–brca1–δ2 in this study.  although this mutation has been shown to inactivate transcriptional activity of a brca1 fusion protein in mammalian cells (12), we found that hf7c transformed by pbd–brca1 modified by p1749r grew on plates lacking histidine, suggesting p1749r had no noticeable impact on his3 gene activation. the brca1 polymorphisms tested had no effect on growth inhibition.  in contrast, one cancer-associated missense mutation, a1708e, completely reverted growth inhibition, and two other missense mutations, m1775r and p1749r, partially reverted growth suppression.  the results for m1775r and p1749r suggest that some mutations will have intermediate effects on growth suppression that may be difficult to interpret, emphasizing the need to evaluate data from this or any functional assay of brca1 in the context of data from the human population.  the reason for incomplete reversion of growth inhibition by the m1775r and p1749r mutations may become clear once the molecular mechanism of brca1-dependent growth suppression is better understood, and it remains possible that the differing effects of missense mutations in this assay may ultimately correlate with differing phenotypes in the human population.   this assay did not detect a cancer-predisposing missense mutation of the ring finger, and only the c-terminal 305 amino acids were required for maximal activity.

2462 ||  although still far from clinical application, these methods have provided important information.   here we apply a transcription-based assay to assess the effect of 22 variants (r1443g, v1534m, d1546n, l1564p, p1614s, e1644g, s1655f, l1664p, t1700a, g1706e, v1713a, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, i1766s, l1764p, q1785h, g1788d, e1794d, v1804d, and p1806a) on the activity of the brca1 cooh terminus (amino acids 1,396–1,863) and interpret the findings in light of all available clinical, genetic, and structural information.  these ucvs were found in individuals from families with breast or ovarian cancer in which no other deleterious mutation in brca1 or brca2 was found, and thus it is not clear whether they are causally related to disease.  go to: materials and methods constructs  control constructs containing the wild-type (wt) brca1, s1613g, m1775r, and y1853x were previously described (12).  mutations r1443g, v1534m, d1546n, l1564p, p1614s, e1644g, s1655f, l1664p, t1700a, g1706e, v1713a, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, i1766s, l1764p, q1785h, g1788d, e1794d, v1804d, and p1806a were introduced by splicing by overlapping extension pcr (20) using plasmid p385-brca1 as template.  primers sequences are available on request. because african americans and hispanics may disproportionately receive uninformative results (28, 29), we paid particular attention to ucvs found in minority populations.  four variants (p1614s, t1700a, q1785h, and e1794d) have been documented in african americans, two (v1713a and g1788d) in hispanics (ref.  30; breast cancer information core database), and two (l1564p and v1804d) in both ethnic groups (30, 31). cells were cotransformed with a lexa-responsive β-galactosidase reporter gene (diagram shown above the graph) and a lexa dbd fusion to residues .  sixteen ucvs in the brctdomains (s1655f, l1664p, t1700a, g1706e, v1713a, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, l1764p, i1766s, g1788d, q1785h, e1794d, v1804d, and p1806a) were also tested.  variants s1655f, t1700a, g1706e, v1713a, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, l1764p, and 1766s displayed markedly decreased activity with <40% of the wt activity in yeast and <20% in mammalian cells ( 2a and b).  as a first approach, we arbitrarily considered >80% and <40% of wt activity as the thresholds to classify the variants as neutral or deleterious, respectively (12).  using this threshold, our data indicate that (a) v1534m, p1614s, e1644g, q1785h, and e1794d do not represent high-risk variants and are likely to be neutral; (b) s1655f, t1700a, g1706e, v1713a, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, l1764p, and i1766s represent deleterious/high-risk variants; (c) variants r1443g, l1546n, l1564p, l1664p, v1804d, and p1806a do not represent high-risk variants, although we cannot rule out the possibility that they may represent moderate-risk variants; and (d) variant g1788d does not represent a neutral variant, although we cannot rule out the possibility that it may represent a moderate-risk variant instead of a deleterious one.  importantly, despite variation in levels in yeast and mammalian assays, no variant presented clearly conflicting results (>80% in one test and <40% in another). 29).  therefore, we analyzed eight variants (l1564p, p1614s, t1700a, v1713a, q1785h, g1788d, e1794d, and v1804d) that have been found in african americans and/or hispanics (30, 31, 42).   using the threshold of activity defined in  4 (>50% for neutrals and <45% for deleterious), variants t1700a, v1713a, and g1788d displayed activity compatible with a deleterious classification, whereas l1564p, p1614s, q1785h, e1794d, and v1804d displayed activity compatible with a neutral classification ( 4). 17).  structural analysis supports a neutral classification for q1785h and v1804d and a deleterious classification for t1700a, v1713a, and g1788d (table 2).  interestingly, the t1700 residue is part of the phosphoserine binding pocket in which it makes hydrogen bonding interactions with the serine hydroxyl group, and it may play an important role in binding specificity (35, 36, 41). we therefore tested two mutations of brca1 that have been difficult to classify because of an uncertain correlation with cancer predisposition.  v1713a was found in the germline of an individual with breast and ovarian cancer from a family with 15 cases of breast or ovarian cancer (26) and was not found in 180 control chromosomes (26) or in a separate database of 3000 chromosomes (m.  luce, personal communication). however, the mutation alters a residue that is isoleucine in murine brca1, and no other cancer-affected relatives were available to verify segregation of the v1713a sequence change with disease, creating ambiguity about the relationship between v1713a and cancer predisposition.  in this assay, yeast transformed with pad–brca1–δ2 modified by v1713a formed easily visible colonies comparable in size and number of cells per colony to m1775r and p1749r cancer-predisposing controls ( (33c), suggesting that v1713a inactivates a function that protects against cancer and is consistent with detection of this sequence change in the germline of an individual with a high probability of hereditary breast–ovarian cancer.   p1637l, like v1713a, was detected in the germline and tumor dna of an individual with early onset ovarian cancer from a family with a history of breast and ovarian cancer (23).

be likely benign replacements, whereas the scp assay indicates possible functional and/or structural defects.  conversely, the structure-based algorithm predicts a deleterious effect of v1804d, a mutation that shows a similar scp to wild type brca1. this confirmation of the potential value of the scp assay highlights the need to understand its biochemical basis.  this understanding table 1

assessment, counseling and preventive care.  the purpose of the present study was to functionally evaluate seven unclassified variants of brca1 including a genomic deletion that leads to the in-frame loss of exons 16/17 (δ exons 16/17) in the mrna, an insertion that leads to a frameshift and an extended carboxy-terminus (5673insc), and five missense variants (k1487r, s1613c, m1652i, q1826h and v1833m).  we analyzed the variants using a functional assay based on the transcription activation property of brca1 combined with supervised learning computational models.  functional analysis indicated that variants s1613c, q1826h, and m1652i are likely to be neutral, whereas variants v1833m, δ exons 16/17, and 5673insc are likely to represent deleterious variants.  in agreement with the functional analysis, the results of the computational analysis also indicated that the latter three variants are likely to be deleterious. those include a deletion of exons 16 and 17 (δ exons 16/17), an insertion mutation (5673insc) leading to a frameshift that produces a protein which is 15 amino acids longer than the wild type, and missense variant q1826h.  four missense variants (k1487r, s1613c, m1652i and v1833m) previously reported in the bic database were also functionally evaluated.  we provide a bioinformatics-based prediction of their impact, and for the variants that affect the brca1 cooh-terminal (brct) domains (δ exons 16/17, 5673insc, m1652i, q1826h and v1833m) we also provide a rationalization of their impact, based on structural modeling. constructs  constructs coding for exons 13–24 (amino acids 1396–1863) of wild-type (wt) brca1, positive (s1613g; neutral), and negative (m1775r and y1853x; deleterious) controls were previously described [14–16].  mutations were generated by splicing by overlapping extension pcr [20] using p385-brca1 [14] (for δ exons 16/17, k1487r, s1613c, q1826h, m1652i, and v1833m) or f3-brca1 [1] (for 5673insc) as template.  pcr products were cloned into plex9 or pgbt9 vectors. two of them (k1487r, s1613c) were chosen in order to increase coverage of the unstructured region of brca1 cooh-terminus and test the hypothesis that variants outside conserved domains are likely to be neutral.  the remaining three (m1652i, q1826h and v1833m) are missense variants in the brct domain and were chosen because they have been previously analyzed for binding to phosphopeptides (m1652i and v1833m)[31, 33], or exposed at the surface of the domain (q1826h) which represents a class of poorly studied variants [18].    1  1 diagram of constructs containing brca1 variants analyzed in this study . functional and computational analysis  . 1 bioinformatics analysis we applied our previously published bioinformatics method ls-snp [18, 25–27] to predict whether the brct missense variants m1652i, q1826h, and v1833m have a deleterious or neutral effect on brca1.  the method uses supervised learning algorithms that integrate a variety of bioinformatics-derived predictive features, including properties of amino acid sequence changes, evolutionary conservation, location in protein structure and predicted impact on protein structure. taken together, the functional data and the structure prediction suggest that both variants constitute deleterious mutations.   the missense variant series (k1487r, s1613c, m1652i, q1826h, and v1833m) was evaluated for transactivation activity exclusively in the context of stringent reporters ( 4a) as previously defined for missense variants [12, 14–16].  variants s1613c, m1652i, and q1826h exhibited activity significantly higher than 50% of the wt activity and are likely to constitute neutral variants ( 4a).  variant v1833m showed reduced activity of ~30% compared to the wild type in yeast and a markedly reduced activity in mammalian cells.  thus, it is likely to be a deleterious variant ( 4a). differences in activity could not be accounted for by differences in protein levels, as expression of fusion constructs did not necessarily correlate with activity ( 4b).    4  4 functional analysis of missense variants in brca1 table 1 summarizes the results obtained when the missense variants located at the brct region (m1652i, q1826h, and v1833m) were rationalized based on our structural models.  variant v1833m is predicted to disrupt the hydrophobic core of the brct domain. thus, although the conservative nature of the change and its location in a nonconserved and unstructured region may suggest neutrality, it is not possible to provide a classification for this variant without additional data.   on the other hand, variant v1833m presented activity comparable to that of the negative control variants (, significantly below 45% of the wild type) and is therefore classified as a deleterious allele.  it has also been shown to destabilize the brct in vitro but its thermal unfolding seems to be only moderately affected and it remains able to bind phosphopeptides when measured by isothermal titration calorimetric experiments [31, 52]. it should be noted that an early version of a computational prediction model suggested that m1652i and v1833m were likely to be neutral.  while the results for the m1652i were a rationalization of a preliminary qualitative functional assay, the v1833m was a prediction by the model.  the rule-based decision tree used by the model arrived at a neutral classification by considering solely that the valine to methionine substitution was a likely amino acid change.  in conclusion, we analyzed a series of missense, frameshift, and in-frame deletion variants of brca1 for which clinical information was not available or not informative.  using a combination of functional analysis and structural predictions we tentatively classify variants v1833m, 5673insc and δ exons 16/17 as likely to be deleterious and missense variants m1652i, s1613c, and q1826h as likely to be neutral.   abstract  the brca1 gene from individuals at risk of breast and ovarian cancers can be screened for the presence of mutations. we are still not able to do segregation analysis because of difficulties in obtaining samples from affected and healthy relatives.   some other rare missense mutations were identified only once inside the brct domains of brca1, including a1823t (exon 23), v1833m (exon 24), p1856s (exon 24) which need further investigation in order to classify them.   alterations identified in exonic or intervening sequences of brca1 and brca2 corresponding to polymorphisms or unclassified variants in this study of the

published mutations by us are also included in order to give a complete figure of the observed mutations in greek population for future use as markers. for example, variants that are moderately well folded based on proteolytic stability can often be purified and studied in more detail.  circular dicroism spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry have been used to quantitatively assess the fold stability of v1696l, r1699w, m1775k, m1775r, m1783t, v1808a, v1809f, and v1833m (49–51).  although our proteolytic assay indicated that the stability of two of these variants, r1699w and v1808a, were indistinguishable from wild-type, the more sensitive thermodynamic studies of the purified forms of these variants reveal a small but significant reduction in fold stability.

2467 ||  it was shown that the transcriptional activation assay could be used as a test to characterise mutations in the carboxy-terminus region of brca1 encompassing residues 1396–1863.  thirteen missense variants (h1402y, l1407p, h1421y, s1512i, m1628t, m1628v, t1685i, g1706a, t1720a, a1752p, g1788v, v1809f, and w1837r) were specifically investigated.  conclusions: while individual classification schemes for brca1 alleles still present limitations, a combination of several methods provides a more powerful way of identifying variants that are causally linked to a high risk of breast and ovarian cancer. along those lines, we hypothesised that unclassified missense variants located in regions of brca1 that contribute to transcription activation besides the brct domains might be amenable to a transcription based classification.  in the present study we show that the transcriptional activation assay can be used as a test to characterise mutations in the region encompassing aa 1396–1863 (exons 13 to 24) and we specifically investigated 13 missense variants (h1402y, l1407p, h1421y, s1512i, m1628t, m1628v, t1685i, g1706a, t1720a, a1752p, g1788v, v1809f, and w1837r).  in addition, we analysed all the mutations using a prediction algorithm based on interspecific sequence variation and grantham matrices. dpn1 was subsequently added to digest the parental plasmid leaving only cdnas with the introduced mutations to be transformed into bacteria.  mutations h1421y, s1512i, p1614s, m1628t, m1628v, t1685i, t1700a, t1720a, g1788v, v1809f, and w1837r were introduced using splicing by overlapping extension pcr. 26 the first round of pcr was undertaken using the following primers: h1421y 39 region (h1421y-u2, 59 gttagaacag tatgggagccagccttct;

ux13). all were at a frequency of 0/500.  the remaining variants were assessed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) with the following frequencies: h1402y (0/500), l1407p (0/500), h1421y (0/500), s1512i (6/500), s1613g (260/500), m1628v (0/500), m1628t (0/500), t1685i (0/500), w1837r (0/500), and y1853x (0/500).  variants t1720a and v1809f were not assessed. the intermediate results for these mutants suggest that they may represent moderate rather than high risk variants.  six additional variants (h1402y, l1407p, h1421y, s1512i, m1628t, and m1628v) in locations outside the brct domains were also investigated for their effect on transcription.  three of the variants were located in a region in which a putative coiled coil domain has been predicted to form (fig 2a).31 variant l1407p showed significantly reduced transcription activation levels consistent with a high risk mutation (fig 2b, 2c).  variants h1402y, h1421y, and s1512i showed transcription activation levels equal to or higher than wild type brca1, suggesting that they do not represent high risk variants and are likely to have low clinical significance.  in yeast cells, protein levels were slightly variable in three independent clones. once it was verified that the extended assay assigned positive and negative controls correctly, seven missense variants in the brct domain and six variants outside the brct domain were tested (fig 2).  the variants were chosen because they were identified as the sole brca1 alteration in individuals considered to be at high risk for breast or ovarian cancer (s1512i, m1628v, m1628t, t1685i, g1706a, t1720a, a1752p, g1788v, v1809f, and w1837r) or were located at or in close proximity to the putative coiled-coil domain (h1402y, l1407p, and h1421y).  seven of the variants caused a dramatic loss of the transcription activation function (l1407p, m1628v, t1685i, a1752p, g1788v, v1809f, and w1837r), similar to known high risk mutation controls, suggesting that they may constitute deleterious/high risk variants (fig 2b and 2c; table 1).  four of the variants (h1402y, h1421y, s1512i, and m1628t) showed transcription activation similar to or greater than the wild type brca1, suggesting they are probably neutral/low clinical significance variants.  the two remaining variants had intermediate results. interestingly, results for g1706a suggested again that the available information is not enough to classify it.  while no conclusion can be drawn for variants that have very low frequency and are not found to co-occur with a deleterious mutation (for example, l1407p and h1421y), co-occurrence data indicated that h1402y, s1512, and m1628t do not represent high risk variants, confirming the functional assay results.  in order to further cross validate our analysis we compared it with results from three published methods to classify variants in the brct domain (table 1).  the first method is table 1 comprehensive analysis of brca1 variants exon mutation nucleotide change* allowed residues  txn` iv1 pdg ps** st   bic`` co11 comments 13 h1402y c4323t hdynk # # nd na na 1 1 reduces the probability to form coiled coil   structure from  to  13 l1407p t4339c l n ? nd na na 1 0 conserved stretch;

however, given that fact that pedigree analysis, transcriptional activation, and protease sensitivity indicate a high risk variant, our conclusion is that, although the change is a conservative one, the side chain size threshold in the algorithm needs to be refined.  in summary, we have classified six missense variants (l1407p, m1628v, t1685i, a1752p, g1788v, and v1809f) as probable deleterious/high risk variants and the remainder as probable neutral/low clinical significance variants (h1402y, h1421y, s1512i, m1628t, and t1720a), with two variants (g1706a and w1837r) left unclassified.  previously, all the known deleterious missense changes were in the ring domain or brct repeats.

basal-like breast cancer, the e3 ligase activity of brca1 appears to be dispensable for tumor suppression.   a role for the e3 ligase activity in brca1 tumor suppression was predicated partly on the fact that this activity is ablated by certain tumor-associated lesions of the ring domain, such as the c61g and c64g missense mutations (6).  however, these mutations also disrupt the interaction between brca1 and its partner protein bard1 (5). because mammary-specific inactivation of either brca1 or bard1 elicits breast tumors with the same basal-like phenotype (15), the tumor suppression activity of brca1 is probably mediated by the brca1/bard1 heterodimer.  unlike the tumorigenic c61g and c64g mutations, the synthetic i26a mutation used in this study specifically ablates the enzymatic activity of brca1 but allows proper assembly of the brca1/bard1 heterodimer (7).  thus, the tumorigenic ring mutations are likely to compromise brca1-mediated tumor suppression primarily by impairing brca1/bard1 heterodimerization.g.  c61g) (8, 9).  brca1 also comprises two brct motifs at the c terminus.g.  c61g) and in the c-terminal brct domain, impair brca1 dna repair function (1, 21, 22).  cellular brca1 is detected primarily in the nucleus and found to cluster in discrete nuclear “foci” during dna replication at s-phase (23, 24). similarly, three other frequently studied c-terminal brct mutants, p1749r, m1775r, and y1853x, all displayed a dramatic decrease in foci localization compared with the wild-type protein.  in contrast, the n-terminal ring domain mutant c61g, which is defective for ubiquitin ligase activity (8), was only modestly reduced in its overall ability to form foci and still exhibited a potent response to ir treatment (59% of cells with >10 foci).  note that only nuclear-stained cells were scored and that bard1 can stimulate nuclear localization of all the brca1 mutants tested (33, 34). these perturbations may explain why the brca1 brct mutants are not recruited to mdc1-positive dna repair foci (see  2).  on the other hand, the n-terminal ring mutation c61g, which has been shown to abolish ubiquitin ligase activity of the brca1-bard1 heterodimer (8, 9), did not impair movement of brca1 into ir-induced foci in our experiments.  this suggests that brca1 nuclear focus formation may be independent of ubiquitin ligase activity. class 4 is likely pathogenic (probability of being pathogenic is –), and class 5 is definitely pathogenic (probability >).  according to variants described in the [lindor  (2012)] system, three of the variants in this study (m18t, c61g, and m1775r) were of class 4, either likely pathogenic or definitely pathogeni an additional five mutants are treated clinically as class 5, pathogenic, (c39y, c44f, c47g, c64g, and r71g).  one of these pathogenic mutants, r71g, does not affect the brca1 protein, but rather the splicing of the mrna [vega , 2001]. a subset of brca1 missense substitutions inhibited growth with bard1 at high 3at concentrations (100 mm).  these were mutations of zn2þ-binding residues, either previously confirmed or strongly expected to be pathogenic (c24r, c44f, c61g and to a lesser extent h41r and c39r).  the e2:brca1 interaction was more sensitive to missense substitution, 16 variants showed no interaction with the e2 at the lowest concentration of 3at (1 mm), with 21 brca1 variants failed to grow at 3 mm 3at ( 2a). importantly, the inhibition of ubiquitin ligase activity, through loss of the e2 interaction, was not restricted to structurally detrimental mutations

 2b).   figure 2 figure 2 functional analysis of missense variants in brca1. in mammalian cells, several variants showed decreased expression levels, suggesting instability of the protein product ( 2d).  nevertheless, protein levels in mammalian cells seem to be a poor predictor of overall activity as v1534m or q1785h, for example, showed very low levels but with activity comparable to wt ( 2b and d).   as a first approach, we arbitrarily considered >80% and <40% of wt activity as the thresholds to classify the variants as neutral or deleterious, respectively (12).  using this threshold, our data indicate that (a) v1534m, p1614s, e1644g, q1785h, and e1794d do not represent high-risk variants and are likely to be neutral; (b) s1655f, t1700a, g1706e, v1713a, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, l1764p, and i1766s represent deleterious/high-risk variants; (c) variants r1443g, l1546n, l1564p, l1664p, v1804d, and p1806a do not represent high-risk variants, although we cannot rule out the possibility that they may represent moderate-risk variants; and (d) variant g1788d does not represent a neutral variant, although we cannot rule out the possibility that it may represent a moderate-risk variant instead of a deleterious one.  importantly, despite variation in levels in yeast and mammalian assays, no variant presented clearly conflicting results (>80% in one test and <40% in another). we also combined it with a predicted deleterious variant, l1407p, in the same motif (12).  in addition, we arbitrarily chose m1628v, located in the vicinity of the polymorphism, and two other variants, v1534m and t1685i, located at approximately the same distance from the polymorphism.  the presence of s1613g did not affect the activity of deleterious (s1613g/l1407p and s1613g/t1685i) or neutral (s1613g/h1402y, s1613g/v1534m and s1613g/m1628v) variants ( 3). clinical data  pedigrees corresponding to six variants analyzed here illustrate the difficulties in inferring causality even in large kindreds (supplementary  s1).   v1534m the proband in this italian family (m933) was diagnosed with ovarian and bilateral breast cancer and tested positive for the variant.  loss of heterozygosity (loh) and sequencing analysis in one of the proband's breast tumors revealed loss of the wt allele. these results also highlight the difficulty in relying on limited pedigree data that may suggest cosegregation with the cancer phenotype (supplementary  s1).   we also did functional tests on 14 additional variants and functionally classified six (r1443g, v1534m, d1546n, e1644g, l1664p, and p1806a) as neutral and eight (s1655f, g1706e, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, l1764p, and i1766s) as deleterious ( 4).  the v1534m classification is supported by co-occurrence data (table 2) whereas the d1546n classification is supported by clinical data, specifically from family 230 (supplementary  s1) in which at least two affected women have been shown not to carry the variant.

using other compounds may have additional value.  it is known that brca1- and brca2- defi cient cells are extremely sensitive to parp1 inhibition ( 28, 29 ), leading to a larger dynamic range between brca2- defi cient cells and isogenic brca2-profi cient controls than for cisplatin ( 30 ). it was shown that the transcriptional activation assay could be used as a test to characterise mutations in the carboxy-terminus region of brca1 encompassing residues 1396–1863.  thirteen missense variants (h1402y, l1407p, h1421y, s1512i, m1628t, m1628v, t1685i, g1706a, t1720a, a1752p, g1788v, v1809f, and w1837r) were specifically investigated.  conclusions: while individual classification schemes for brca1 alleles still present limitations, a combination of several methods provides a more powerful way of identifying variants that are causally linked to a high risk of breast and ovarian cancer. along those lines, we hypothesised that unclassified missense variants located in regions of brca1 that contribute to transcription activation besides the brct domains might be amenable to a transcription based classification.  in the present study we show that the transcriptional activation assay can be used as a test to characterise mutations in the region encompassing aa 1396–1863 (exons 13 to 24) and we specifically investigated 13 missense variants (h1402y, l1407p, h1421y, s1512i, m1628t, m1628v, t1685i, g1706a, t1720a, a1752p, g1788v, v1809f, and w1837r).  in addition, we analysed all the mutations using a prediction algorithm based on interspecific sequence variation and grantham matrices.5 6 mutation h1402y was introduced by direct pcr using primers 24endt and h1402y-u (59 ggaattccagaggg ataccatgcaatataacc 39).  mutations l1407p, a1752p, and g1706a were introduced by the quickchange (stratagene) method according to the manufacturer’s instruction.  the following primers containing the alteration of interest were used for pcr involving the wild type constructs produced in a methylation competent bacterial strain, and amplification was carried out using pfu polymerase.  l1407p (l1407p-u, 59 ctgatcaagccccagca gg 39; l1407p-l, 59 cctgctggggcttgatcag 39); g1706a

gtcctgggattctcgaggtcgctttggaccttgg 39).  dpn1 was subsequently added to digest the parental plasmid leaving only cdnas with the introduced mutations to be transformed into bacteria. these results suggest a high sensitivity and specificity for this assay.  results frequency in control populations six variants (g1706a, a1708e, a1752p, m1775r, g1788v, and w1837r) were assessed using pcr/ldr followed by assessment in a dna microarray30 in 500 healthy women without cancer of varying ages (18–40 years) and ethnic groups.  all were at a frequency of 0/500. results show that both in yeast and mammalian cells the three negative controls located in the brct domain lose most of transcription activation function consistent with a loss of function mutation, whereas the positive control s1613g had an activity equal to or higher than the wild type, as observed previously5 6 (fig 2b and 2c).  seven unclassified missense variants in the brct domains (t1685i, g1706a, t1720a, a1752p, g1788v, v1809f, and w1837r) were then tested.  variants t1685i, a1752p, g1788v, v1809f, and w1837r showed greatly decreased transcription activation 140 phelan, ðapic´, tice, et al www.com levels (at least ,50%) both in yeast and mammalian cells, comparable with the known mutant controls and consistent with their classification as deleterious/high risk variants (fig 2b and 2c).  variants g1706a and t1720a showed slightly reduced transcription activation levels in yeast cells, at 64% and 74%, respectively, of the wild type control.  interestingly, whereas t1720a had activity comparable to wild type in mammalian cells, g1706a showed a markedly reduced activity.32 for the analysis of co-segregation we assumed an allele frequency of the variant of  and a penetrance model with separate age specific risks of breast and ovarian cancer for brca1 based on meta-analysis estimates. 33 we obtained six pedigrees for five variants (m1628t, g1706a, t1720a, v1809f, and w1837r) (fig 3).  for m1628t we obtained odds against causality of :1, consistent with the data obtained in the functional assay.  for g1706a we obtained odds against causality of :1.  this rather uninformative result reflects the fact that this large pedigree with multiple cases typed had one case diagnosed at age 53 that did not carry the variant.jmedgenet. com fact that g1706a may be a moderate rather than a high risk variant.  for variant v1809f the odds in favour of causality were :1, consistent with the functional test, suggesting that it is a high risk variant. the classification based on interspecific sequence variation confirms our choice of controls, with s1613g being classified as neutral and m1775r, a1708e, and y1853x being classified as deleterious.  it also confirms our functional results for h1402y, l1407p, t1685i, g1706a, g1788v, and w1837r.  variant m1628v, however, was classified as a neutral/low risk variant in contradiction of our functional results. once it was verified that the extended assay assigned positive and negative controls correctly, seven missense variants in the brct domain and six variants outside the brct domain were tested (fig 2).  the variants were chosen because they were identified as the sole brca1 alteration in individuals considered to be at high risk for breast or ovarian cancer (s1512i, m1628v, m1628t, t1685i, g1706a, t1720a, a1752p, g1788v, v1809f, and w1837r) or were located at or in close proximity to the putative coiled-coil domain (h1402y, l1407p, and h1421y).  seven of the variants caused a dramatic loss of the transcription activation function (l1407p, m1628v, t1685i, a1752p, g1788v, v1809f, and w1837r), similar to known high risk mutation controls, suggesting that they may constitute deleterious/high risk variants (fig 2b and 2c; table 1). the two remaining variants had intermediate results.  g1706a showed a slightly reduced activity in yeast but a markedly reduced activity in mammalian cells.  variant t1720a had a slightly reduced activity in yeast and but activity comparable to wild type brca1 in mammalian cells. based on the results obtained we would tentatively classify t1720a as a neutral/low clinical significance variant.  at this point we cannot classify variant g1706a.  we then carried out an analysis using interspecific variation, pedigree analysis, and co-occurrence data (table 1). of the seven variants for which the method based on interspecific variation was able to reach a conclusion, the data confirmed the classification based on our functional tests in six cases (l1407p, h1402y, t1685i, g1706a, g1788v, and w1837r) but presented a contradiction for variant m1628v.  the pedigree analysis confirmed our results for brca bilat 42 m brca 29 m brca 35 m brca 55 m prophylactic mastectomy lund 897 m = v1809f

is indicated. results from pedigree analysis for w1837r contradicted all the other methods, although the odds against causality were rather small.  interestingly, results for g1706a suggested again that the available information is not enough to classify it.  while no conclusion can be drawn for variants that have very low frequency and are not found to co-occur with a deleterious mutation (for example, l1407p and h1421y), co-occurrence data indicated that h1402y, s1512, and m1628t do not represent high risk variants, confirming the functional assay results. in order to further cross validate our analysis we compared it with results from three published methods to classify variants in the brct domain (table 1).  the first method is table 1 comprehensive analysis of brca1 variants

compared our data with results derived from a method based on protein structure parameters to predict the outcome of different variants of brca for the seven variants for which there is a prediction, six (t1685i, g1706a, t1720a, a1752p, g1788v, and w1837r) confirmed the results obtained.  in fact, the g1706a variant was considered not explained by the algorithm because the qualitative yeast data used to test for g1706a indicated wild type function while the algorithm predicted a functional impact.  it is possible that g1706a may represent a moderate/ low risk variant and our current methods are not yet powerful enough to recognise this.  variant v1809f was contradictory; however, given that fact that pedigree analysis, transcriptional activation, and protease sensitivity indicate a high risk variant, our conclusion is that, although the change is a conservative one, the side chain size threshold in the algorithm needs to be refined.  in summary, we have classified six missense variants (l1407p, m1628v, t1685i, a1752p, g1788v, and v1809f) as probable deleterious/high risk variants and the remainder as probable neutral/low clinical significance variants (h1402y, h1421y, s1512i, m1628t, and t1720a), with two variants (g1706a and w1837r) left unclassified.  previously, all the known deleterious missense changes were in the ring domain or brct repeats. brca1 plays diverse cellular roles and it is unlikely that any single functional assay will accurately reflect the total cellular implications of missense mutations in this gene.   objective  to elucidate the effect of two brca1 variants, 5236g>c (g1706a) and 5242c>a (a1708e) on brca1 function, and to survey the relative usefulness of several assays to direct the characterisation of other unclassified variants in brca genes.   methods and results  data from a range of bioinformatic, genetic, and histopathological analyses, and in vitro functional assays indicated that the 1708e variant was associated with the disruption of different cellular functions of brca1. how well the data from such predictions correlate with the results of biochemical and functional studies on the same variant, however, is yet to be established.   we have set out to determine the pathogenicity of two sequence variants, g1706a and a1708e, using a number of genetic, bioinformatic, biochemical, and cellular investigations.  although a1708e has been classified as a missense mutation by bic, the precise molecular defect is not understood, nor has the variant been formally evaluated in the multifactorial model of causality. missense changes within this motif cause protein folding defects18,25 and inhibit transcriptional transactivation. 14 the g1706a and a1708e variants are located in the first brct domain (amino acids 1650–1736) and have been partially characterised by predictive modelling and some functional assays (reviewed in mirkovic et al38).  here we present data from a wider variety of approaches that further test these predictions and provide a cellular and molecular basis for pathogenic risk assessment.asp).  two australian pedigrees in which affected index cases were ascertained to be carriers of the brca1 5236g>c (g1706a) variant and one australian pedigree with the affected index case carrying the 5242c>a (a1708e) variant were selected for analysis.  sequencing or denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (dhplc) analysis of the coding and flanking intronic regions of brca1 and brca2 in the index cases revealed no other mutations.   a spanish pedigree carrying the g1706a variant was ascertained by the genetics service, hospital de la santa creu i sant pau, barcelona, spain.  in the index case of this pedigree, the 1706a change was detected by mutation analysis of brca1 and brca2 using sscp methodology and sequencing to confirm the nucleotide alteration, and relatives were screened for the variant by sequencing. subsequently, other carriers within the family were identified by restriction enzyme assay.   in total, 29 individuals from the g1706a pedigrees and 19 individuals from the a1708e pedigrees were genotyped.  we estimated the odds for causality associated with these variants using a bayes factor analysis by maximising the evidence in favour of causality over the hazard ratio, based on the method described by thompson 9 in order to determine the penetrance associated with the variants, we used a modified segregation analysis,39 which estimates cumulative risk to age 70 of breast cancer in carriers (although, due to the small sample size, 95% confidence intervals of cumulative risk may be underestimated), where models were fitted under maximum likelihood theory using the mendel statistical package.43 a 383 bp fragment of cdna flanking the 1706 and 1708 positions of brca1 was generated by rt‐pcr using the superscript iii reverse transcriptase kit from invitrogen and primers check1f (5′‐ccagaagaatttatgctcgtg) and or (5′‐cagctgtaccatccattcca).  as positive and negative controls, fragments were also generated with the same primers from the pzeosv based expression constructs containing wildtype, g1706a, and a1708e brca1 cdna (see below).  pcr products were purified using a qiagen qiaquick pcr purification kit (qiagen, valencia, ca, usa). the 1706a and 1708e mutations were generated in this plasmid using the stratagene quikchange pcr site directed mutagenesis protocol (stratagene, la jolla, ca, usa).  primer pairs for the g1706a mutagenesis protocol were quik5236f

generated in a pgal4b expression construct containing the brca1 activation domain within a region spanning amino acids 1293–186348 using the stratagene quikchange pcr site directed mutagenesis protocol.  primer pairs for generating the 1706a variant were g1706af 5′‐ggacactgaaatattttctagcaattgcgggaggaaaatg‐3′ and g1706ar 5′‐cattttcctcccgcaattgctagaaaatatttcagtgtcc‐3′ and primers for the

three breast cancer patients (ages at diagnosis: 66 and 44 years) and the single ovarian cancer patient (age at diagnosis: 45 years) were found to be 1706a carriers, whereas one woman diagnosed with breast cancer at age 53 was not a carrier.35 the bayes factor calculated for this family was  with a likelihood for causality ratio of 1:.  in australian g1706a pedigree no.  2, the sole surviving

breast and ovarian cancer and therefore was presumed to have been inherited from the father (not tested) who had no known family history of cancer.  the bayes factor analysis for the spanish g1706a

and 1708e breast tumours go to: discussion using genetic and bioinformatics analyses, functional assays, and histopathology, we have attempted to determine the pathogenicity of the brca1 1706a and 1708e variants, and to assess these approaches for their potential use in the characterisation of other brca1 and brca2 unclassified variants. however, these inconsistencies may be due to differences in cell lines and the length of brca1 cdna used.   the histopathology review of the g1706a carrying tumour from the australian and spanish pedigrees did not have a brca1 associated tumour phenotype.  the loss of the wildtype allele in this tumour may simply reflect background loh, which is estimated to be about 30% in breast tumours. however, this variant remains formally designated as unclassified according to the criteria of goldgar et al8 after application of the multifactorial likelihood model using sequence alignment and co‐segregation data.  in contrast, analysis of the g1706a variant in functional assays suggests that it is unlikely to be associated with significant risk of breast cancer and may be classified as benign according to the criteria of goldgar 8 while classification of 1708e and other variants may ultimately be achieved by analysis of further co‐segregation data, and inclusion of loh and control frequency data in the multifactorial likelihood model, we suggest the application of an appropriate selection of the functional assays described here and elsewhere will enhance predictions of pathogenicity of unclassified sequence variants in brca1 and brca2.  assay selection will largely be determined by the location of unclassified sequence variants within known structural or functional motifs in the gene.  in our hands, the cytoplasmic mislocalisation, proteolytic sensitivity, and centrosome amplification assays were found to be the most informative for the functional analysis of the g1706a and a1708e variants in the brct domain of brca1.  these assays may also be useful for variants affecting other regions of the protein. 30–32).  in only one case (g1706a), the qualitative assessment differed because it was considered of moderate effect previously and of no effect in the present study.  this shows the high reproducibility of the transcriptional assays. for the variants with no functional effect, a large majority (28 of 35, 80%) falls into the c0 class, three are classified as c15, and two are classified as c25.  only one of them, g1706a, received a high score in align gv-gd, c55.  another variant at this position (g1706e) scored as c65, but this variant was classified with moderate functional effect by structure/function assays.

table 1). we then carried out an analysis using interspecific variation, pedigree analysis, and co-occurrence data (table 1).  of the seven variants for which the method based on interspecific variation was able to reach a conclusion, the data confirmed the classification based on our functional tests in six cases (l1407p, h1402y, t1685i, g1706a, g1788v, and w1837r) but presented a contradiction for variant m1628v.  the pedigree analysis confirmed our results for brca bilat 42 m brca 29 m brca 35 m brca 55 m prophylactic mastectomy lund 897 m = v1809f 1 brca 41 brca 66 brca 55 brca 44 wt m wt wt m brca 54 brca 51 cl-8 m = t1720a 3 brca 81 brca 85 wt f92 m = t1720a brca 55 brca 44 m brca 40 m wt brca 48 brca 49 ov 54 t334 m = m1628t brca 52 brca? 52 m wt wt m wt m m m m wt wt wt m 6-99-006 m = g1706a 2 brca65 br 44-54 brca 87 ov 45 brca 53 m792 m = w1837r othca 70 (colon?) prostate leukaemia? 78 m brca 40? sto cns? 42 brca 39 homcs 57 ovarian disgerminoma 27 m ovcs 58 bladder 53 wt brca 52 wt brca > 70? figure 3 pedigrees of missense variants in brca1.40 segregates with disease. 14 clinical data favour classification as deleterious mutation;

however, given that fact that pedigree analysis, transcriptional activation, and protease sensitivity indicate a high risk variant, our conclusion is that, although the change is a conservative one, the side chain size threshold in the algorithm needs to be refined.  in summary, we have classified six missense variants (l1407p, m1628v, t1685i, a1752p, g1788v, and v1809f) as probable deleterious/high risk variants and the remainder as probable neutral/low clinical significance variants (h1402y, h1421y, s1512i, m1628t, and t1720a), with two variants (g1706a and w1837r) left unclassified.  previously, all the known deleterious missense changes were in the ring domain or brct repeats. structural studies reveal that both arg1699 and met1775 make critical direct contacts to the phosphopeptide (12–14), and structural investigations of the m1775r and m1775k variants reveal subtle structural rearrangements that block the +3 specificity pocket (37,47).  two of the cancer-associated (iarc class 5) variants, i1766s and g1788v, were highly defective in the proteolysis and transcriptional assays; however, they showed significant levels of nonspecific peptide binding, independent of phosphorylation.  it is likely that the unfolded state of these variants exposes hydrophobic residues that are responsible for these nonspecific interactions, as suggested previously (14).
2491 ||  we have also described eight of the variants as of “moderate functional effect” in which a preponderance of the data points to a loss of function.  these include variants with intermediate levels of peptide binding specificity (w1837g and a1843p) or transcriptional activity (v1696l, g1706e, and h1746n), and strong defects in all of the other assays.  in addition, we have included three additional mutants in this group that show poor agreement between the different assays but are likely to directly affect the peptide-binding surface.

human cells14; block the ability of the brct domain to interact with ctip15,16, histone deacetylases17 and bach1 (ref.com letters nature structural biology • volume 8 number 10 • october 2001 841 to directly test the structural consequences of these mutations, we assayed the sensitivity of dual-repeat brct domain proteins that harbor these mutations to proteolytic degradation ( 4a).  both wild type and mutant proteins were produced by in vitro transcription/translation because neither the mutant bearing a nonsense mutation at tyr 1853 (1853-ter) nor the a1708e missense mutant could be expressed in soluble form in e.  coli. the wild type protein is highly resistant to digestion by trypsin, elastase or chymotrypsin, indicating that the in vitro produced brct protein is stably folded.  in contrast, the tyr 1853 truncation mutation and a1708e mutants are almost completely degraded by low concentrations of all enzymes, indicating that these proteins are not stably folded under the assay conditions.  the m1775r mutant displays an intermediate sensitivity to proteolytic degradation, suggesting that the m1775r mutant exhibits a subtler structural defect. brca1 plays diverse cellular roles and it is unlikely that any single functional assay will accurately reflect the total cellular implications of missense mutations in this gene.   objective  to elucidate the effect of two brca1 variants, 5236g>c (g1706a) and 5242c>a (a1708e) on brca1 function, and to survey the relative usefulness of several assays to direct the characterisation of other unclassified variants in brca genes.   methods and results  data from a range of bioinformatic, genetic, and histopathological analyses, and in vitro functional assays indicated that the 1708e variant was associated with the disruption of different cellular functions of brca1. in contrast, functional assays of the 1708e variant indicate that it is pathogenic, possibly through subcellular mislocalisation.  however, the combined odds of 262:1 in favour of causality of this variant does not meet the minimal ratio of 1000:1 for classification as pathogenic, and a1708e remains formally designated as unclassified.  our findings highlight the importance of comprehensive genetic information, together with detailed functional analysis for the definitive categorisation of unclassified sequence variants. how well the data from such predictions correlate with the results of biochemical and functional studies on the same variant, however, is yet to be established.   we have set out to determine the pathogenicity of two sequence variants, g1706a and a1708e, using a number of genetic, bioinformatic, biochemical, and cellular investigations.  although a1708e has been classified as a missense mutation by bic, the precise molecular defect is not understood, nor has the variant been formally evaluated in the multifactorial model of causality. missense changes within this motif cause protein folding defects18,25 and inhibit transcriptional transactivation. 14 the g1706a and a1708e variants are located in the first brct domain (amino acids 1650–1736) and have been partially characterised by predictive modelling and some functional assays (reviewed in mirkovic et al38).  here we present data from a wider variety of approaches that further test these predictions and provide a cellular and molecular basis for pathogenic risk assessment.asp).  two australian pedigrees in which affected index cases were ascertained to be carriers of the brca1 5236g>c (g1706a) variant and one australian pedigree with the affected index case carrying the 5242c>a (a1708e) variant were selected for analysis.  sequencing or denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (dhplc) analysis of the coding and flanking intronic regions of brca1 and brca2 in the index cases revealed no other mutations. in the index case of this pedigree, the 1706a change was detected by mutation analysis of brca1 and brca2 using sscp methodology and sequencing to confirm the nucleotide alteration, and relatives were screened for the variant by sequencing.   two english a1708e pedigrees were ascertained by the clinical genetics service at guy's hospital in london, united kingdom.  the a1708e variant was identified in the index case of the first pedigree (uk1708e1) by sscp, followed by sequencing to confirm the mutation. the other member of the family tested was screened for the variant by restriction enzyme analysis.  in the second english pedigree (uk1708e2), the a1708e variant was identified in the proband by hydroxylamine fluorescent chemical cleavage of mismatch followed by sequencing confirmation.  subsequently, other carriers within the family were identified by restriction enzyme assay.   in total, 29 individuals from the g1706a pedigrees and 19 individuals from the a1708e pedigrees were genotyped.  we estimated the odds for causality associated with these variants using a bayes factor analysis by maximising the evidence in favour of causality over the hazard ratio, based on the method described by thompson 9 in order to determine the penetrance associated with the variants, we used a modified segregation analysis,39 which estimates cumulative risk to age 70 of breast cancer in carriers (although, due to the small sample size, 95% confidence intervals of cumulative risk may be underestimated), where models were fitted under maximum likelihood theory using the mendel statistical package.43 a 383 bp fragment of cdna flanking the 1706 and 1708 positions of brca1 was generated by rt‐pcr using the superscript iii reverse transcriptase kit from invitrogen and primers check1f (5′‐ccagaagaatttatgctcgtg) and or (5′‐cagctgtaccatccattcca).  as positive and negative controls, fragments were also generated with the same primers from the pzeosv based expression constructs containing wildtype, g1706a, and a1708e brca1 cdna (see below).  pcr products were purified using a

(5′‐cccattttcctcccgcaattgctagaaaatatttcagtgtc‐3′).  the primer pairs for the a1708e mutagenesis protocol were rtw5242f (5′ctgaaatattttctaggaattgagggaggaaaatgggtagttag‐3′) and rtw 5242r (5′‐ctaactacccattttcctccctcaattcctagaaaatatttcag‐3′).  the brca1 5382insc deletion mutant expression plasmid was kindly donated by dr b weber, university of pennsylvania, usa.  transcriptional transactivation assays  the 1706a and 1708e variants were generated in a pgal4b expression construct containing the brca1 activation domain within a region spanning amino acids 1293–186348 using the stratagene quikchange pcr site directed mutagenesis protocol.  primer pairs for generating the 1706a variant were g1706af 5′‐ggacactgaaatattttctagcaattgcgggaggaaaatg‐3′ and g1706ar 5′‐cattttcctcccgcaattgctagaaaatatttcagtgtcc‐3′ and primers for the a1708e mutagenesis protocol were rtw5242f/r, described above.  assays were carried out as described previously,48 with two exceptions. the likelihood of causality for the 1706a variant using the bayes factor analysis method for the combined australian and spanish families was 1:2274.   in the australian a1708e pedigree, both living members with breast cancer (ages at diagnosis: 47 and 58 years) were found to carry the 1708e variant.  the deceased mother of a carrier was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 47, and a deceased cousin of a carrier was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 30 years. the bayes factor analysis for this pedigree yielded odds of causality of :1.  in the pedigree uk1708e2, two a1708e variant carriers were identified.  one carrier was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 39 years. the other carrier has not been diagnosed with cancer to date.  two other individuals from this pedigree without breast cancer were tested and found to be negative for the a1708e variant.  the bayes factor analysis for this pedigree yielded a ratio of :1, equating to an odds of causality of 1:.  the total bayes factor for the combined australian and english a1708e pedigrees was :1 in favour of causality, and the estimated penetrance for a1708e was 100% (95% ci 98% to 100%) to age 70 years.   neither the 1706a nor 1708e variants were detected in any of the 180 control samples. loss of the wildtype allele was demonstrated in tumour tissue from one case from the australian g1706a no.  1/6‐99‐006 and a1708e pedigrees (data not shown).  however, in the tumour sample isolated from the spanish g1706a pedigree, no loh was detected.  no loh data were available from the united kingdom a1708e pedigrees.   snupe assay  the relative expression of wildtype and variant alleles was measured using the snupe assay.  figure mg33258. f1 figure 1 rna stability of brca1 variants g1706a and a1708e in carriers from australian pedigrees.  snupe assays were carried out on homozygous wildtype (wt) and variant control plasmid pcr products, and rt‐pcr products from rna isolated . evolutionary sequence alignment analysis gave odds in favour of causality of 58:1 for 1708e.  however, the genetic evidence of pathogenicity from the a1708e pedigrees is weak, giving an odds of causality of :1.  applying the multifactorial likelihood model8 to assess pathogenicity, the combined odds from these two approaches was 262:1, which does not meet the criteria of goldgar et al8 of 1000:1 for a pathogenic variant. this meets the criteria of goldgar et al8 of 1:100 for a neutral variant, consistent with the functional assays indicating that this variant is not a high risk mutation.   in conclusion, we have presented genetic, histopathological, and functional evidence to suggest that the a1708e variant of brca1 is pathogenic, as classified by bic, possibly through subcellular mislocalisation.  however, this variant remains formally designated as unclassified according to the criteria of goldgar et al8 after application of the multifactorial likelihood model using sequence alignment and co‐segregation data. assay selection will largely be determined by the location of unclassified sequence variants within known structural or functional motifs in the gene.  in our hands, the cytoplasmic mislocalisation, proteolytic sensitivity, and centrosome amplification assays were found to be the most informative for the functional analysis of the g1706a and a1708e variants in the brct domain of brca1.  these assays may also be useful for variants affecting other regions of the protein. bead-immobilized peptide affinity resin was prepared by incubating a 10-fold molar excess of a biotinylated phosphopeptide (srstpsptfnk) and the corresponding unphosphorylated peptide (srstsptfnk) with streptavidin agarose beads (sigmaaldrich).  seven mutants, with the wild-type brca1-brct (1,646–1,858) as a positive control, and m1775r and a1708e as negative controls were examined at a time.  the intensities of the bands were measured and the backgrounds were corrected using imagequant (amersham biosciences), and the measurements were normalized against the wild-type measurement taken in the same day. on the other hand, a pilot study involving 25 of the brca1 brct missense variants showed that certain single amino acid substitutions in the brct domain of brca1 can destabilize its structure, leading to increased susceptibility to trypsin-mediated proteolysis (29).  the assay is sufficiently sensitive to discriminate wild-type protein from the strongly destabilized variant a1708e as well as the moderately destabilized variant m1775r.  proteolysis of each of the missense variants was carried out at a series of trypsin concentrations, and the amount of full-length protein remaining was visualized by sdspage.  the results were compared with those of the wild-type protein as well as the m1775r and a1708e variants carried out in parallel.  we quantified the percentages of fulllength protein remaining following digestion at different concentrations of trypsin and determined the severity of the destabilizing effects by comparing the percentage of protein remaining following digestion at 10 μg/ml trypsin to the controls (supplementary  s2a). author manuscript;

moderately destabilizing mutations were defined as those with a similar stability to m1775r (between 5% and 65% of the protein remaining after digestion with 10 μg/ml of trypsin). analysis of the phosphopeptide binding activity of brct missense variants the brca1 brct domain interacts with bach1 and several other proteins through the selective recognition of the peptide motif pser-x-x-phe (10–14,44).  all mutations that have been strongly linked to disease using family-based data, such as a1708e and m1775r (1,35), fail to bind specifically to pser-x-x-phe–containing peptides as shown in a pilot study that analyzed the peptide binding activities of 25 brca1 brct domain variants (14).  this indicates the functional importance of the brca1 brct domain as a phosphopeptidebinding module in tumor suppression. we tested binding to a phosphorylated version of the peptide containing the brca1 target sequence pser-pro-thr-phe or an unphosphorylated version as a control.  the results were compared with experiments with the wild-type brca1 brct as well as with the peptide binding–deficient variants a1708e and m1775r carried out in parallel.  we present two analyses of the

previously studied with the scp assay, except s1841a [caligo , 2009; coyne , 2004; humphrey , 1997].  our results were consistent with these previous studies.  a1708e and y1853x cells formed colonies almost equal in size to vector cells, p1749r and m1775r cells displayed an intermediate phenotype, and m1652i cells were similar to brca1 cells ( 3b).  these results indicate that our assay behaves similarly to those employed by other laboratories. however, variability among the independent transformants of each strain was low enough in the lm assay (highlighted by the weak standard deviations,  3c) to allow statistical differences between strains, which finally lead to conclusions in agreement with those from the scp assay.  using the pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations recorded in databases (m18t, c44y, c47f, c61g, a1708e, and y1853x in table 2), sensitivity was estimated to be 83% (5/6) for each assay.  consequently, our results show that assays relying on growth, such as scp or lm assays, can be used for variants positioned in both nter and cter parts of brca1. mutations of brca1 impair the spot formation in the nucleus  we then selected eight mutations showing various effects on scp and generated cells expressing mutated brca1 fused to mcherry.  a1708e and y1853x mutations strongly decreased the proportion of cells showing one spot ( 3d).  in both cases, the proportions of cells with two spots or more became predominant ( for a1708e and  for y1853x) and most of the cells exhibited no spot in the nucleus (table 1).  the spot formation was also markedly reduced for the c61g mutation even if, contrary to a1708e and y1853x, the localization remained essentially in the nucleus.  these data, unexpected for c61g, show that single amino acid changes in the primary structure of brca1–mcherry have the same impact on the ylp as large truncations (e. some variants, such as m18t, decrease the brca1 aggregation, which remains localized in the nucleus.  others, such as a1708e, have a more pronounced effect, with brca1 aggregation taking place essentially in the cytoplasm (sup  s7).  in all cases, aggregates are presumably amorphous rather than amyloid like (sup  s8). two arguments support this notion.  first, most of the deleterious mutations located in brct, including a1708e, p1749r, and m1775r, disturb the correct folding of these domains [lee , 2010; williams , 2003].  second, the western blot results, observed for δ(1–66), δ(1755–1863), a1708e, and y1853x ( 2a and b), suggest a link between the slightly increased amount of lower molecular weight bands and the delocalized aggregation into the cytoplasm. lastly, it could provide further information concerning the biological effect of variants, beyond the deleterious/neutral classification.  thus, a1708e and y1853x induce a delocalization of brca1 in the cytoplasm, which could explain the loss of function of the brca1 nuclear protein for these deleterious variants.   c61g is a deleterious mutation. in an attempt to clarify the functional importance of the brca1 cterminus as a transcription activator in cancer predisposition, we have characterized the effect of c-terminal germ-line variants identified in scandinavian breast and ovarian cancer families.  missense variants a1669s, c1697r, r1699w, r1699q, a1708e, s1715r, g1738e and a truncating mutation, w1837x, were characterized using yeast- and mammalian-based transcription assays.  in addition, four additional missense variants (v1665m, d1692n, s1715n, and d1733g) and one in-frame deletion (v1688del) were included in the study. our result is in agreement with pedigree analysis in which the mutation segregates with the disease (figure 2, lund 190).  variants c1697r, a1708e, s1715r and g1738e displayed loss of activity suggesting that they represent disease-associated mutations (table 1), an observation in agreement with pedigree analysis for mutations c1697r, a1708e and s1715r (figure 2).  the amino acid substitution c1697r is a rather dramatic one, from a nonpolar residue capable of forming disulfide linkages to a positively charged residue, located in a critical α-helix based on the structure of xrcc1 brct (29). thus, combined clinical data indicates association between the variant and breast cancer.  variant a1708e is reported to the bic database 14 times including our finding in lund 20.  it has been previously shown to cause loss of function in different assays (18,19,27) and the presence of a1708e in lund 20 further demonstrates the variant as a disease-associated mutation. we therefore sought to test the effect of brca1 missense mutations on the activity of pad–brca1–δ2 in this assay.  yeast transformed by pad–brca1–δ2 modified by a1708e, a missense mutation predisposing to cancer (23), formed large colonies equal in size to vector controls ( (33 b and c).  two other mutations, m1775r (6, 23) and p1749r (24), each partially inactivated the growth inhibitory function of pad–brca1–δ2 ( (3,3, b and c).  the results correlate with published data that a1708e, m1775r, and p1749r abrogate the transcriptional activity of brca1 fusion proteins in other assays (12, 13).  protein expression levels were similar for all constructs by western blotting. the brca1 polymorphisms tested had no effect on growth inhibition.  in contrast, one cancer-associated missense mutation, a1708e, completely reverted growth inhibition, and two other missense mutations, m1775r and p1749r, partially reverted growth suppression.  the results for m1775r and p1749r suggest that some mutations will have intermediate effects on growth suppression that may be difficult to interpret, emphasizing the need to evaluate data from this or any functional assay of brca1 in the context of data from the human population.
2493 ||  results sift and polyphen prediction programs identify probably deleterious nonsynonymous missense variants the mutational analysis of 276 hereditary breast and ovarian cancer families, performed by automatic direct sequencing of all coding regions and intron–exon boundaries, has revealed several novel as well as previously described variants of brca1 gene.  by using two prediction software programs, sift and polyphen, seven nonsynonymous variants likely disrupting the gene function, n132 k, y179c, n550 h, s1164i, s1512i, i1766s, a1789 t, were identified.  among those, two variants, the 3610g4t (3491g4t, s1164i) and the 5484g4a (5365g4a, a1789 t), were studied for the first time in this analysis; the variant 5416t4g (5295t4g, i1766s) has been classified as deleterious mutation by other studies [carvalho , 2007]. three have been previously reported as probably neutral: the 655a4g (536a4g, y179c) has been reported by judkins  [2005]; the 1767a4c (1648a4c, n550 h) was classified as probably neutral by tavtigian  [2006]; and the 515c4a (396c4a, n132 k) has been reported as likely to be of no or little clinical significance by easton  [2007].  finally, the variant 4654g4t (4535g4t, s1512i) was reported as neutral by deffenbaugh  [2002] and confirmed by tavtigian  [2006].  out of the 13, 6 were predicted as neutral by both programs: 477g4a (358g4a, d120n);

table 1).  four of the variants (h1402y, h1421y, s1512i, and m1628t) showed transcription activation similar to or greater than the wild type brca1, suggesting they are probably neutral/low clinical significance variants.  the two remaining variants had intermediate results. in order to further cross validate our analysis we compared it with results from three published methods to classify variants in the brct domain (table 1).  the first method is table 1 comprehensive analysis of brca1 variants exon mutation nucleotide change* allowed residues  txn` iv1 pdg ps** st   bic`` co11 comments 13 h1402y c4323t hdynk # # nd na na 1 1 reduces the probability to form coiled coil   structure from  to  13 l1407p t4339c l n ? nd na na 1 0 conserved stretch;

however, given that fact that pedigree analysis, transcriptional activation, and protease sensitivity indicate a high risk variant, our conclusion is that, although the change is a conservative one, the side chain size threshold in the algorithm needs to be refined.  in summary, we have classified six missense variants (l1407p, m1628v, t1685i, a1752p, g1788v, and v1809f) as probable deleterious/high risk variants and the remainder as probable neutral/low clinical significance variants (h1402y, h1421y, s1512i, m1628t, and t1720a), with two variants (g1706a and w1837r) left unclassified.  previously, all the known deleterious missense changes were in the ring domain or brct repeats.

however, it shows an intermediate level of transcriptional activity.  the neutral (iarc class 1) variant v1736a exhibited the least agreement between the different assays, showing significant sensitivity to proteolysis and a strong transcriptional defect while showing intermediate/strong levels of phosphopeptide interaction. we have also described eight of the variants as of “moderate functional effect” in which a preponderance of the data points to a loss of function.  these include variants with intermediate levels of peptide binding specificity (w1837g and a1843p) or transcriptional activity (v1696l, g1706e, and h1746n), and strong defects in all of the other assays.  in addition, we have included three additional mutants in this group that show poor agreement between the different assays but are likely to directly affect the peptide-binding surface. only one of them, g1706a, received a high score in align gv-gd, c55.  another variant at this position (g1706e) scored as c65, but this variant was classified with moderate functional effect by structure/function assays.  these results suggest substitution of a small side chain at position 1,706 is tolerated, but not substitution of the larger, charged glu. although still far from clinical application, these methods have provided important information.   here we apply a transcription-based assay to assess the effect of 22 variants (r1443g, v1534m, d1546n, l1564p, p1614s, e1644g, s1655f, l1664p, t1700a, g1706e, v1713a, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, i1766s, l1764p, q1785h, g1788d, e1794d, v1804d, and p1806a) on the activity of the brca1 cooh terminus (amino acids 1,396–1,863) and interpret the findings in light of all available clinical, genetic, and structural information.  these ucvs were found in individuals from families with breast or ovarian cancer in which no other deleterious mutation in brca1 or brca2 was found, and thus it is not clear whether they are causally related to disease.  go to: materials and methods constructs  control constructs containing the wild-type (wt) brca1, s1613g, m1775r, and y1853x were previously described (12).  mutations r1443g, v1534m, d1546n, l1564p, p1614s, e1644g, s1655f, l1664p, t1700a, g1706e, v1713a, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, i1766s, l1764p, q1785h, g1788d, e1794d, v1804d, and p1806a were introduced by splicing by overlapping extension pcr (20) using plasmid p385-brca1 as template.  primers sequences are available on request. cells were cotransformed with a lexa-responsive β-galactosidase reporter gene (diagram shown above the graph) and a lexa dbd fusion to residues .  sixteen ucvs in the brctdomains (s1655f, l1664p, t1700a, g1706e, v1713a, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, l1764p, i1766s, g1788d, q1785h, e1794d, v1804d, and p1806a) were also tested.  variants s1655f, t1700a, g1706e, v1713a, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, l1764p, and 1766s displayed markedly decreased activity with <40% of the wt activity in yeast and <20% in mammalian cells ( 2a and b).  as a first approach, we arbitrarily considered >80% and <40% of wt activity as the thresholds to classify the variants as neutral or deleterious, respectively (12).  using this threshold, our data indicate that (a) v1534m, p1614s, e1644g, q1785h, and e1794d do not represent high-risk variants and are likely to be neutral; (b) s1655f, t1700a, g1706e, v1713a, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, l1764p, and i1766s represent deleterious/high-risk variants; (c) variants r1443g, l1546n, l1564p, l1664p, v1804d, and p1806a do not represent high-risk variants, although we cannot rule out the possibility that they may represent moderate-risk variants; and (d) variant g1788d does not represent a neutral variant, although we cannot rule out the possibility that it may represent a moderate-risk variant instead of a deleterious one.  importantly, despite variation in levels in yeast and mammalian assays, no variant presented clearly conflicting results (>80% in one test and <40% in another). these results also highlight the difficulty in relying on limited pedigree data that may suggest cosegregation with the cancer phenotype (supplementary  s1).   we also did functional tests on 14 additional variants and functionally classified six (r1443g, v1534m, d1546n, e1644g, l1664p, and p1806a) as neutral and eight (s1655f, g1706e, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, l1764p, and i1766s) as deleterious ( 4).  the v1534m classification is supported by co-occurrence data (table 2) whereas the d1546n classification is supported by clinical data, specifically from family 230 (supplementary  s1) in which at least two affected women have been shown not to carry the variant.  structural analysis is consistent with the classification of all brct variants (s1655f, l1664p, g1706e, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, l1764p, i1766s, and p1806a; table 1).  however, caution should be exercised in the classification until further evidence for these thresholds is obtained.
2498 ||  to determine whether the uvs under study caused mislocalisation of brca1 and/or defects in nuclear foci formation and therefore were likely to be pathogenic, we transfected mcf-7 cells with the expression constructs and measured foci formation and cytoplasmic localisation.  as expected, wild-type brca1 and a known benign variant (r496c) showed a strong increase in ir-inducible nuclear foci (figure 3).  a similar, albeit variable, response was seen in cells expressing brca1 a1708v.
2499 ||  the v191d variant was also defective for ssa repair (lane 31).  interestingly, the s153r and s186y variants had diminished activity, but the change in activities was not statistically significant from the wild type.  thus, these variants were not scored as defective.
2500 ||  most variants that showed less than wild-type activity in the proliferation assay also scored as functionally impaired in the cisplatin sensitivity assay and were classifi ed as deleterious ( table 1 ,  table 1.    functional classifi cation of brca1 vus based on cisplatin response variant dna change type of mutation a classifi cation s4f 11c>t vus not clear m18t 53t>c vus deleterious 185delag 68_69delag deleterious control deleterious b k45q 133a>c vus neutral c61g 181t>g deleterious control deleterious c64g 190t>g vus deleterious b d67y 199g>t vus neutral y105c 314a>g neutral control neutral n132k 396c>a vus neutral p142h 425c>a vus neutral l147f 441g>c vus neutral l165p 494t>c vus neutral r170w 508c>t vus neutral s186y 557c>a vus neutral v191i 571g>a vus neutral t231m 692c>t vus neutral d245v 734a>t vus neutral l246v 736t>g vus neutral v271l 811g>c vus neutral s308a 922a>g; 923g>c artifi cial h not clear l358r; c360r; e362h 1073t>g; 1078t>c; 1084g>c; 1086g>t artifi cial neutral l668f 2002c>t vus neutral d695n 2083g>a vus neutral p798l 2393c>t vus neutral n810y 2428a>t vus neutral t826k 2477c>a vus neutral (continued) downloaded from cancerdiscovery. aacrjournals.
2501 ||  for the remaining three exposed mutations that abolish transcription, we propose that they disrupt interactions with brca1 ligand(s).  they are located in a groove formed by both brct repeats (l1657p and k1702e) and in the ridge that delimits the groove (e1660g).  we suggest that this clustering of residues in a single patch on the surface of brca1 highlights a binding site with integrity that is necessary for transcription.

2512 ||  classification of these variants into pathogenic or non-pathogenic type is an important challenge in genetic diagnosis and counseling.  the aim of the present study is to functionally assess a set of 7 missense vus (q1409l, s1473p, e1586g, r1589h, y1703s, w1718l and g1770v) located in the c-terminal region of brca1 by combining in silico prediction tools and structural analysis with a transcription activation (ta) assay.  the in silico prediction programs gave discrepant results making its interpretation difficult. structural analysis of the three variants located in the brct domains (y1703s, w1718l and g1770v) reveals significant alterations of brct structure.  the ta assay shows that variants y1703s, w1718l and g1770v dramatically compromise the transcriptional activity of brca1, while variants q1409l, s1473p, e1586g and r1589h behave like wild-type brca1.  in conclusion, our results suggest that variants y1703s, w1718l and g1770v can be classified as likely pathogenic brca1 mutations. our results indicate that three of them (y1703s, w1718l, g1770v) have significant functional impact and may represent pathogenic brca1 variants while the remaining four do not have a functional impact.   go to: materials and methods brca1 vus  seven missense brca1 c-terminal variants (q1409l, s1473p, e1586g, r1589h, y1703s, w1718l and g1770v), identified through genetic testing of patients with suspicion of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (hbocs) as part of the hereditary cancer program of the catalan institute of oncology, were included in this study (figure 1).  written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. table 1 shows the outcomes of all methods, for comparison with high discrepancy between different programs.  the two integrative algorithms indicate that variants q1409l, s1473p, e1586g and r1589h have a benign effect and that g1770v has a damaging effect, whereas they disagree in their predictions for variants y1703s and w1718l.  furthermore the results of pon-p and condel for q1409l and g1770v strikingly diverge from those of align-gvgd, which classify q1409l as most likely to interfere with brca1 function and g1770v as less likely using the alignment from human to frog. the luciferase activity of these three mutants was very similar to that observed for the known pathogenic mutants used as controls: that is <5%, compared to the wild-type construct.  conversely, the remaining four vus (q1409l, s1473p, e1586g and r1589h) displayed similar transcriptional activity to that of the wild-type construct.   figure 2 figure 2 results of functional assay of the studied missense variants. the variants selected were vus identified in a clinical scenario, which are located between amino acid residues 1,396 and 1,863 of the full-length brca1 sequence and include part of a coiled-coil domain (aa 1,364–1,437) and the brct tandem domains (aa 1,646–1,863) (figure 1).  notably, six of the vus (q1409l, s1473p, e1586g, y1703s, w1718l and g1770v) had not been recorded in the locus-specific database for mutations in brca1 and brca2, bic (breast cancer information core database, http://research. nhgri.  the use of different in silico prediction algorithms gave contradictory results for some of the variants (table 1) making it difficult to draw any clear conclusion.  for example, there is a striking difference between the results for three versions of polyphen-2 as run from different sources; w1718l can yield probabilities of pathogenicity of ,  and , while the probabilities for q1409l, s1473p and e1586g range from values below  to values above  in the different versions.  if we tried to order the variants according to their deleteriousness as predicted from each of the algorithms, they would yield as many orders as algorithms tested.  in general terms, the two integrative programs gave quite similar results, predicting a damaging effect for one of the variants (g1770v) and a benign effect for four of them (q1409l, s1473p, e1586g and r1589h), while variants y1703s and w1718l were difficult to classify.  therefore, attending to the results obtained in this study, we consider the use of in silico programs not reliable enough to get an approximation of the pathogenicity of a given vus.

2518 ||  however, it remains difficult to determine whether many single amino-acid (missense) changes in the brca1 protein that are frequently detected in the clinical setting are pathologic or not.  here, we used a combination of functional, crystallographic, biophysical, molecular and evolutionary techniques, and classical genetic segregation analysis to demonstrate that the brca1 missense variant m1775k is pathogeni functional assays in yeast and mammalian cells showed that the brca1 brct domains carrying the amino-acid change m1775k displayed markedly reduced transcriptional activity, indicating that this variant represents a deleterious mutation.  importantly, the m1775k mutation disrupted the phosphopeptide-binding pocket of the brca1 brct domains, thereby inhibiting the brca1 interaction with the proteins brip1 and ctip, which are involved in dna damage-induced checkpoint control. these variants create serious management problems in the families concerned and are often frustrating to deal with.  to date, there is no comprehensive functional assay available for brca1 mutations and much has been written about the approaches that can be used to classify variants, summarized in goldgar 1 in general, it is easier to conclude that a variant is non-pathogenic than pathogenic, a point illustrated by chenevix-trench et al2 who studied 10 brca1 variants by a combination of methods and identified one as being definitely pathogeni  in the present study, we investigated the rare variant m1775k, which occurs in the brct domains at the c terminus of brca1.  the particular functional significance of the brca1 brct repeats has become increasingly recognized,3 especially because they mediate interactions with proteins involved in cell cycle checkpoint control and double-stranded dna repair, including brip1, a dna helicase previously known as bach14 that is also a breast cancer susceptibility protein,5 and the co-repressor cti6 the m1775k variant was identified in two unrelated families of european ancestry with a history of breast cancer but its contribution to the pathogenesis of this disease has not been determined.  here, we used a combined approach encompassing a number of scientific disciplines to demonstrate that m1775k is pathogeni specifically, the m1775k mutation disrupts the phosphopeptide-binding pocket of the brca1 brct domains, thereby inhibiting the brca1 interaction with the proteins brip1 and cti these results indicate that the integrity of the brct phosphopeptide-binding pocket is critical for the tumor suppression function of brca1.  it is important to emphasize the need for a multi-disciplinary approach to determine pathogenicity, and this study, while focused on only one variant, argues for an in-depth characterization of all unclassified variants, particularly when their individual frequency is very low.   go to: methods samples  the m1775k variant was identified by sequencing in two unrelated families who had presented to cancer genetics services with a history of breast cancer and had undergone routine full brca1/brca2 mutation analysis.  both families consented to further study of the variant. immunohistochemical analysis for the estrogen, progesterone and her2 receptors was performed using standard protocols.   prior probability of pathogenicity from evolutionary conservation and substitution severity analysis  m1775k was subjected to align-gvgd and sift analysis using a full-length brca1 protein multiple sequence alignment containing nine mammalian sequences plus sequences from chicken, frog and pufferfish; the alignment is available at http://agvgd. iarfr/alignments. when one factor was missing, the marginal probabilities were used.  the overall score for histopathology is the product of the likelihood ratios for each tumor evaluated carrying the m1775k variant.  the posterior probability is calculated from the prior probability (based on sequence data) and the likelihood ratio for causality (from histopathology and co-segregation) using bayes rule, posterior = prior × lr/(prior × lr + 1–prior).   loh analysis  tumor tissue from one of the affected brca1 m1775k carriers was both macro- and micro-dissected (using laser capture microdissection) from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (ffpe) tissue, and dna was extracted from the collected cells using the qiaamp dna mini kit (qiagen, mississauga, ontario, canada) according to the manufacturer's instructions for ffpe samples.  three microsatellite markers within brca1 (d17s855, d17s1322 and d17s1323) were genotyped using radioactively labeled pcr products from dna isolated from blood and tumor tissue from our carrier using the qiagen hotstar taq pcr system (qiagen) (primer sequences and annealing temperatures are listed in supplementary table 1). control constructs containing the wild-type brca1, s1613g, m1775r and y1853x were previously described. 16 variant m1775k was introduced by splicing using overlapping extension pcr17 with p385-brca1 (gift from michael erdos) as template.  the first round of pcr was performed using the following primers: m1775k 3′ region (umk, 5′-ccttcaccaacaagcccacaggatcaactg-3′; 24endt, 5′-gcggatcctcagtagtggctgtgggggat-3′); m1775k 5′ region (m1775k-r, 5′-cagttgatctgtgggcttgttggtgaagg-3′; ux13, 5′-cggaattccagagggataccatgcaa-3′).3 the blots were incubated with clontech's α-gal4 dbd monoclonal antibody (for mammalian cells) or α-lexa dbd monoclonal antibody (for yeast cells).   structural and biophysical analysis  protein purification and crystallization a dna fragment encoding the brca1 brct domains (residues 1649–1858) harboring the variant m1775k and carrying an n-terminal 3c protease site was amplified by pcr and cloned into a modified pmal-c2x vector (neb).  brca1 brct m1775k was expressed as a fusion with hexahistidine-tagged maltose-binding protein (6h-mbp) in escherichia coli c41(de3) cells, purified on ni-nta resin and eluted with 200 mm imidazole. the n-terminal vector-derived residues gp were not visible in the final electron density ma the residues gln1756, arg1762 and thr1802 have poor stereochemistry and appear in the disallowed region of the ramachandran plot.   isothermal titration calorimetry binding affinities of the brct m1775k protein for the brip1 and ctip phosphopeptides were measured using a vp-itc micro-calorimeter (microcal).  briefly,  mm of brip1 and  mm of ctip peptides were titrated against  and  mm brct m1775k protein, respectively, in phosphate-buffered saline, 300 mm nacl, ph , at 25° as controls,  mm of brip1 and  mm of ctip were titrated against  and  mm wild-type brca1 brct protein, respectively, under the same conditions. precise protein and peptide concentrations were determined by quantitative amino-acid analysis on an abi 420a derivatizer/analyser and an abi 130a separation system (applied biosystems).   coordinates the atomic coordinates and structure factors of brca1 brct m1775k have been deposited in the protein data bank (accession code 2ing).   go to: results the pedigrees of the two families in which the brca1 m1775k variant was identified are shown in figure 1 and the tumor characteristics and available genotypes are listed in table 2. in family a, which is of western european ancestry, the proband presented with a history of bilateral breast cancer at the ages of 43 and 44 years.  the m1775k variant was identified in her and on further testing it was also present in her affected aunt, which made her affected deceased mother an obligate carrier.  one of the daughters of aii.2, had dcis at 58 years.  this daughter did not carry the m1775k variant.  in family b, which is of greek ancestry, the proband was diagnosed at age 26 years with stage 1 breast cancer. pathology revealed a high-grade, 1 cm infiltrating medullary carcinoma, which had negative estrogen, progesterone and her2 receptor status.  genetic testing detected the m1775k variant in her and in addition she had a d1778n variant 3 codons downstream, which was not present in family a, indicating that the families are unrelated.  the proband's father had no personal or family history of cancer and testing showed that he did not carry the m1775k or the d1778n variant, indicating that the variants were synteni on the basis of this, we assumed that the variant had been inherited from her mother, an assumption strengthened by the fact that she was diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer at age 46 years and metastatic colon cancer at age 65 years (both cancers were confirmed on pathology). the proband reported that both her maternal grandmother and her great aunt had breast and colon cancer in their 50s (unconfirmed).  two maternal aunts, unaffected at ages 61 and 69 years were both tested and found not to carry the m1775k variant.   figure 1 figure 1 pedigrees of the two families with m1775k variants.  mutation status is indicated by wt, wild-type; v, brca1 m1775k variant.  blacked-in shapes indicate a cancer diagnosis. histopathological data, using er status and grade where available, contribute odds in favor of the variant being deleterious of 77:1.  combined together, these data result in odds in favor of m1775k being deleterious versus neutral of 385:1.  if a:iii.2 is considered as affected at the age of 58 years, the corresponding figure is 235:1 and if considered as unaffected, the odds would be 1675:1.  combining these likelihoods with the prior probability, the ranges of posterior probabilities that m1775k is a high-risk variant varies between 500:1 (a:iii. 2 excluded), 333:1 (a:iii. the loh data showed loss of the wild-type (wt) allele, which provided additional supportive evidence for a deleterious variant.   cgh analysis  cgh analysis of the brca1 m1775k tumor from b:iv. 1 using a 1 mb bac array demonstrated many genomic aberrations, among which were high-level amplifications (figure 2a). the characteristic brca1 aberrations, gain on chromosome 3q and loss on 5q,28,29 are clearly present.  using the shrunken centroids classifier,28 the m1775k tumor scored , which classifies it as brca1-like.  in figure 2b, the average ratios for brca1-related and sporadic tumors are depicted with the fluorescence ratios of the m1775k tumor for the 191 bacs included in the classifier. it shows that for most clones the tumor more closely resembles the aberrations present in the brca1-related tumors.   figure 2 figure 2 (a) array cgh profile of m1775k from individual b:iv. 1 showing the genomic position (x axis) and fluorescent ratio for all 3277 bacs (blue dots) and estimated copy number levels as determined by cgh segmentation software (yellow line). functional analysis  to assess the functional impact of the changes in brca1, we determined the transcriptional activity of the c-terminal region of brca1 in which the variant was introduced.  the m1775k missense variant was evaluated for transactivation activity in the context of stringent reporters (figure 3) and displayed markedly reduced activity with 20 and <5% of the wild-type activity in yeast and mammalian cells, respectively (figure 3a and b).  in both cases, the activity was comparable to the deleterious variant m1775r, which has been previously described. 30,31 although protein levels in yeast cells for the m1775k variant were lower than the wild type, they were similar to the positive control s1613g, a neutral variant, suggesting that the reduced activity by the m1775k variant cannot be accounted for by differences in expression levels (figure 3c).  in addition, protein levels in mammalian cells were similar for all constructs tested (figure 3d). because an analysis of a large series of variants validated by genetic data indicated that 50% of the wt activity can be considered the threshold for classification into deleterious or neutral,16 these functional results indicate that m1775k is likely to represent a deleterious change.   figure 3 figure 3 functional analysis of m1775k in brca1.  (a) quantitative transcriptional assay in yeast cells. cells were co-transformed with a lexa-responsive β-galactosidase reporter gene (diagram shown above the graph) and a lexa dbd fusion to residues 1396–1863 .  m1775k abrogates brca1 binding to brip1 and ctip  it was previously shown that the brca1 brct domains bind to the brip1 phosphopeptide isrstpsptfnkq (ps denoting phosphoserine) that corresponds to residues 985–996 of human brip1 with a dissociation constant (kd) of  μm, and to the ctip phosphopeptide ptrvspspvfgat (residues 322–333 of human ctip) with a kd of  μm. 31 to investigate the effects of the m1775k variant on the binding properties of brcts, we used isothermal titration calorimetry to measure the affinities of the brct m1775k protein for the aforementioned brip1 and ctip phosphopeptides. strikingly, these studies showed that brct m1775k had no measurable affinities for the brip1 and ctip peptides (figure 4a and b).  additional isothermal titration calorimetry experiments using increased concentrations of the protein (twofold) and peptides (fourfold) did not show any significant heat changes beyond those of dilution heat (data not shown), demonstrating that the brct m1775k variant does not bind to the brip1 and ctip peptides.  by contrast, both phosphopeptides interacted with wild-type brca1 brct protein (figure 4c and d) with affinities identical to those reported previously.31 taken together, these results indicate that the lys1775 side chain interferes with the brct–ligand interaction.   figure 4 figure 4 representative isothermal titration calorimetry results obtained for the interaction of the brip1 and ctip phosphopeptides with variant brca1 brct m1775k (a and b), respectively, and wild-type brca1 brct domains (c and d), respectively.  structural basis for disruption of the brca1–brip1 and brca1–ctip interactions by m1775k  to elucidate the mechanism by which lys1775 interferes with ligand binding at the atomic level, we determined the crystal structure of brca1 brct m1775k at -å resolution. the ctip and brip1 peptides bind to this groove in a two-pronged mode, with the phosphoserine at position 0 (pser 0) binding to a shallow basic pocket (p1) in brct1 and phenylalanine at position +3 (phe +3) entering a hydrophobic pocket (p2) made up of residues from both brct1 and brct2 repeats. 31,34,35 superposition of the unbound mutant brct m1775k with the brca1–ctip crystal structure31 shows that the brct repeats are superimposed very well with a root-mean-square deviation of  å for all cα atoms (figure 5a).  although at this resolution many of the side chains have poor electron density, an annealed σa-weighted omit map shows clear electron density for the side chain of lys1775 (figure 5b). strikingly, the side chain of the substituted lys1775 sterically clashes with the phenyl ring of phe +3 of ctip (figure 5a and c), directly obstructing the insertion of this anchoring group into the p2 pocket.  likewise, superposition of the brct m1775k and brca1–brip134,35 crystal structures reveals an identical steric hindrance between lys1775 and the phenyl group of the brip1 phe +3 (figure 5d).   figure 5 figure 5 (a) ribbons representation of the unbound brca1 brct m1775k structure (shown in green) superimposed to the brca1 brct-ctip crystal structure (pdb 1y98) (brct shown in beige and the peptide as light blue stick model). the α-helices and β .  go to: discussion by using a combination of functional, structural, molecular and evolutionary techniques and classical genetic segregation analysis, we have demonstrated that the brca1 m1775k variant is highly likely to be pathogeni the combination of sequence analysis-based prior probability and segregation analysis-based likelihood ratio gave a strong indication that m1775k is pathogenic, but was not conclusive.  addition of the histopathology-based likelihood ratio yields a convincing posterior probability (greater than 100:1).  brca1-related tumors in general show more genomic aberrations than sporadic tumors, and also show specific chromosomal gains and losses. 11,28,29 the m1775k tumor analyzed here shows clearly abundant chromosomal changes, many of which comprise of small regions on different chromosomes, suggesting many intra-chromosomal breaks.   the shrunken centroids classifier used for brca1 class prediction shows high specificity; no false-positive and false-negative calls were observed on 10 proven brca1-related tumors and 16 sporadic control tumors that were independent of the training sets. 28 the m1775k tumor showed a relatively low score for a brca1-related tumor and is just outside the 95% reference interval for brca1, possibly due to the noise relating to dna quality.  however, it is classified with a positive score and predicted to be brca1-like.16,18,19,39 in addition, because a large set of variants can be tested and results compared across several experiments (provided internal controls are used) it is also a powerful way to cross-validate other methods such as computation prediction models. 40–42 it is interesting to note that a recently described computation prediction model correctly predicted the structural changes and the functional impact of the m1775k change. 40 however, one should use caution when interpreting results from functional assays in the absence of other supporting data. further validation is still needed to determine whether such variants exist, and how frequent they are with clear implications for the specificity of the assay.  moreover, while the brca1 m1775r variant has been described as pathogenic,30,31 this in itself is not sufficient to class m1775k as pathogenic as it is possible for different amino-acid changes at the same position to be benign or pathogenic, for example, the brca1 i15t variant prevents interaction with the e2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme ubch5a, whereas brca1 i15l has no effect. 43  the brca1 region spanning residues 1646–1859 folds into two tandem domains (brct1 and brct2), which interact in a phosphorylation-dependent manner with proteins involved in dna damage-induced checkpoint control, including brip14 and cti6 the present m1775k structure represents the third crystal structure (after m1775r and v1809f44) of a brca1 brct mutant and reveals the mechanism underlying its pathogenicity at the atomic level. for example, a significant number of cancer-associated (iarc classes 5 and 4) variants are not structurally destabilized as determined by the proteolysis assay.  each of these variants (r1699w, m1775r, and m1775k) is highly defective for specific phosphopeptide recognition and transcriptional activity.  structural studies reveal that both arg1699 and met1775 make critical direct contacts to the phosphopeptide (12–14), and structural investigations of the m1775r and m1775k variants reveal subtle structural rearrangements that block the +3 specificity pocket (37,47). for example, variants that are moderately well folded based on proteolytic stability can often be purified and studied in more detail.  circular dicroism spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry have been used to quantitatively assess the fold stability of v1696l, r1699w, m1775k, m1775r, m1783t, v1808a, v1809f, and v1833m (49–51).  although our proteolytic assay indicated that the stability of two of these variants, r1699w and v1808a, were indistinguishable from wild-type, the more sensitive thermodynamic studies of the purified forms of these variants reveal a small but significant reduction in fold stability. in addition, quantitative assays of phosphopeptide binding, such as isothermal titration calorimetry, can reveal the detailed thermodynamics of peptide-brct interactions (50,51).  the structural rearrangements induced by three of these variants, m1775r (47), m1775k (37), and v1809f (14), have been visualized through lee  page 8 cancer res.  author manuscript; available in pmc 2011 june 15. each of the variants affect the +3 specificity pocket formed at the interface between the two brct repeats.  for m1775r and m1775k, the substituted positively charged side chain adopts an orientation that fills the specificity pocket and blocks the binding of the phe side chain at the +3 position of the target peptide.  intriguingly, the v1809f substitution, which occurs far from the +3 pocket, induces a series of conformational adjustments that results in the movement of met1775 to fill the specificity pocket, explaining the loss of peptide binding specificity and transcriptional activity associated with this variant.

2527 ||  it was shown that the transcriptional activation assay could be used as a test to characterise mutations in the carboxy-terminus region of brca1 encompassing residues 1396–1863.  thirteen missense variants (h1402y, l1407p, h1421y, s1512i, m1628t, m1628v, t1685i, g1706a, t1720a, a1752p, g1788v, v1809f, and w1837r) were specifically investigated.  conclusions: while individual classification schemes for brca1 alleles still present limitations, a combination of several methods provides a more powerful way of identifying variants that are causally linked to a high risk of breast and ovarian cancer. along those lines, we hypothesised that unclassified missense variants located in regions of brca1 that contribute to transcription activation besides the brct domains might be amenable to a transcription based classification.  in the present study we show that the transcriptional activation assay can be used as a test to characterise mutations in the region encompassing aa 1396–1863 (exons 13 to 24) and we specifically investigated 13 missense variants (h1402y, l1407p, h1421y, s1512i, m1628t, m1628v, t1685i, g1706a, t1720a, a1752p, g1788v, v1809f, and w1837r).  in addition, we analysed all the mutations using a prediction algorithm based on interspecific sequence variation and grantham matrices. mutations s1613g, a1708e, m1775r, and y1853x were subcloned from previously described constructs. 5 6 mutation h1402y was introduced by direct pcr using primers 24endt and h1402y-u (59 ggaattccagaggg ataccatgcaatataacc 39).  mutations l1407p, a1752p, and g1706a were introduced by the quickchange (stratagene) method according to the manufacturer’s instruction. all were at a frequency of 0/500.  the remaining variants were assessed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) with the following frequencies: h1402y (0/500), l1407p (0/500), h1421y (0/500), s1512i (6/500), s1613g (260/500), m1628v (0/500), m1628t (0/500), t1685i (0/500), w1837r (0/500), and y1853x (0/500).  variants t1720a and v1809f were not assessed. the intermediate results for these mutants suggest that they may represent moderate rather than high risk variants.  six additional variants (h1402y, l1407p, h1421y, s1512i, m1628t, and m1628v) in locations outside the brct domains were also investigated for their effect on transcription.  three of the variants were located in a region in which a putative coiled coil domain has been predicted to form (fig 2a).31 variant l1407p showed significantly reduced transcription activation levels consistent with a high risk mutation (fig 2b, 2c).  variants h1402y, h1421y, and s1512i showed transcription activation levels equal to or higher than wild type brca1, suggesting that they do not represent high risk variants and are likely to have low clinical significance.  in yeast cells, protein levels were slightly variable in three independent clones. the classification based on interspecific sequence variation confirms our choice of controls, with s1613g being classified as neutral and m1775r, a1708e, and y1853x being classified as deleterious.  it also confirms our functional results for h1402y, l1407p, t1685i, g1706a, g1788v, and w1837r.  variant m1628v, however, was classified as a neutral/low risk variant in contradiction of our functional results. co-occurrence data relative to a set of 40 000 individuals (kindly provided amie deffenbaugh, myriad genetics laboratories inc) are listed in table 1.  variants h1402y, s1512, and m1628t co-occur with a deleterious mutation and are therefore unlikely to represent high risk variants, a result supported by the functional assays.  discussion in order to provide a more informative risk assessment for individuals carrying a mutation in brca1 we used several approaches, including association studies and segregation figure 2 functional analysis of missense variants in brca1. once it was verified that the extended assay assigned positive and negative controls correctly, seven missense variants in the brct domain and six variants outside the brct domain were tested (fig 2).  the variants were chosen because they were identified as the sole brca1 alteration in individuals considered to be at high risk for breast or ovarian cancer (s1512i, m1628v, m1628t, t1685i, g1706a, t1720a, a1752p, g1788v, v1809f, and w1837r) or were located at or in close proximity to the putative coiled-coil domain (h1402y, l1407p, and h1421y).  seven of the variants caused a dramatic loss of the transcription activation function (l1407p, m1628v, t1685i, a1752p, g1788v, v1809f, and w1837r), similar to known high risk mutation controls, suggesting that they may constitute deleterious/high risk variants (fig 2b and 2c; table 1).  four of the variants (h1402y, h1421y, s1512i, and m1628t) showed transcription activation similar to or greater than the wild type brca1, suggesting they are probably neutral/low clinical significance variants.  the two remaining variants had intermediate results. we then carried out an analysis using interspecific variation, pedigree analysis, and co-occurrence data (table 1).  of the seven variants for which the method based on interspecific variation was able to reach a conclusion, the data confirmed the classification based on our functional tests in six cases (l1407p, h1402y, t1685i, g1706a, g1788v, and w1837r) but presented a contradiction for variant m1628v.  the pedigree analysis confirmed our results for brca bilat 42 m brca 29 m brca 35 m brca 55 m prophylactic mastectomy lund 897 m = v1809f 1 brca 41 brca 66 brca 55 brca 44 wt m wt wt m brca 54 brca 51 cl-8 m = t1720a 3 brca 81 brca 85 wt f92 m = t1720a brca 55 brca 44 m brca 40 m wt brca 48 brca 49 ov 54 t334 m = m1628t brca 52 brca? 52 m wt wt m wt m m m m wt wt wt m 6-99-006 m = g1706a 2 brca65 br 44-54 brca 87 ov 45 brca 53 m792 m = w1837r othca 70 (colon?) prostate leukaemia? 78 m brca 40? sto cns? 42 brca 39 homcs 57 ovarian disgerminoma 27 m ovcs 58 bladder 53 wt brca 52 wt brca > 70? figure 3 pedigrees of missense variants in brca1. interestingly, results for g1706a suggested again that the available information is not enough to classify it.  while no conclusion can be drawn for variants that have very low frequency and are not found to co-occur with a deleterious mutation (for example, l1407p and h1421y), co-occurrence data indicated that h1402y, s1512, and m1628t do not represent high risk variants, confirming the functional assay results.  in order to further cross validate our analysis we compared it with results from three published methods to classify variants in the brct domain (table 1).  the first method is table 1 comprehensive analysis of brca1 variants exon mutation nucleotide change* allowed residues  txn` iv1 pdg ps** st   bic`` co11 comments 13 h1402y c4323t hdynk # # nd na na 1 1 reduces the probability to form coiled coil   structure from  to  13 l1407p t4339c l n ? nd na na 1 0 conserved stretch;

however, given that fact that pedigree analysis, transcriptional activation, and protease sensitivity indicate a high risk variant, our conclusion is that, although the change is a conservative one, the side chain size threshold in the algorithm needs to be refined.  in summary, we have classified six missense variants (l1407p, m1628v, t1685i, a1752p, g1788v, and v1809f) as probable deleterious/high risk variants and the remainder as probable neutral/low clinical significance variants (h1402y, h1421y, s1512i, m1628t, and t1720a), with two variants (g1706a and w1837r) left unclassified.  previously, all the known deleterious missense changes were in the ring domain or brct repeats.

2534 ||  alternatively, it is a formal possibility that the point mutations in the brca1 protein have both a loss of function phenotype and a dominant negative phenotype.   figure 4 figure 4 identification of brca1 missense mutations that affect homologous recombination eight of the residues that were tested coordinate zinc ions in the ring domain: c24r, c27a, c39y, h41r, c44f, c47g, c61g, and c64g.  it is anticipated that substitution of any of these amino acid residues would have major structural consequences to the protein. these are the same proteins that functioned in homologous recombination.  of note, the brca1 variant proteins m18t and h41r had detectable low level of bard1 binding, but these brca1 variants did not complement the hdr assay.   figure 5 figure 5 effect of brca1 missense variants on association with bard1 correlation of biological function with available clinical data for each brca1 missense mutant  we have summarized the available information for each mutant in table 1, including results of hdr function and bard1 binding (this study), e3 ubiquitin ligase activity and resistance to ionizing radiation (6), and available clinical information. a subset of brca1 missense substitutions inhibited growth with bard1 at high 3at concentrations (100 mm).  these were mutations of zn2þ-binding residues, either previously confirmed or strongly expected to be pathogenic (c24r, c44f, c61g and to a lesser extent h41r and c39r).  the e2:brca1 interaction was more sensitive to missense substitution, 16 variants showed no interaction with the e2 at the lowest concentration of 3at (1 mm), with 21 brca1 variants failed to grow at 3 mm 3at ( 2a). it is possible that the e2 interaction is stabilized by the presence of bard1 in the biochemical assay.  the brca1:e2 interaction requires integrity of the brca1 n-terminus the bard1 interaction was less sensitive to missense substitution of brca1 than the e2 interaction and restricted to the flanking helices that form the brca1:bard1 interaction face (q12y, l82p) and the zn2þ-ligating residues of the ring (c39s/l, h41r, c44r, c47r and c61l) ( 3h).  however, the impact of these variants was measurable only at high concentrations of 3at, or in a high threshold assay, suggesting that these mutations weaken the high-affinity bard1:brca1 interaction.

table 1). although still far from clinical application, these methods have provided important information.   here we apply a transcription-based assay to assess the effect of 22 variants (r1443g, v1534m, d1546n, l1564p, p1614s, e1644g, s1655f, l1664p, t1700a, g1706e, v1713a, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, i1766s, l1764p, q1785h, g1788d, e1794d, v1804d, and p1806a) on the activity of the brca1 cooh terminus (amino acids 1,396–1,863) and interpret the findings in light of all available clinical, genetic, and structural information.  these ucvs were found in individuals from families with breast or ovarian cancer in which no other deleterious mutation in brca1 or brca2 was found, and thus it is not clear whether they are causally related to disease.  go to: materials and methods constructs  control constructs containing the wild-type (wt) brca1, s1613g, m1775r, and y1853x were previously described (12).  mutations r1443g, v1534m, d1546n, l1564p, p1614s, e1644g, s1655f, l1664p, t1700a, g1706e, v1713a, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, i1766s, l1764p, q1785h, g1788d, e1794d, v1804d, and p1806a were introduced by splicing by overlapping extension pcr (20) using plasmid p385-brca1 as template.  primers sequences are available on request. cells were cotransformed with a lexa-responsive β-galactosidase reporter gene (diagram shown above the graph) and a lexa dbd fusion to residues .  sixteen ucvs in the brctdomains (s1655f, l1664p, t1700a, g1706e, v1713a, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, l1764p, i1766s, g1788d, q1785h, e1794d, v1804d, and p1806a) were also tested.  variants s1655f, t1700a, g1706e, v1713a, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, l1764p, and 1766s displayed markedly decreased activity with <40% of the wt activity in yeast and <20% in mammalian cells ( 2a and b).  as a first approach, we arbitrarily considered >80% and <40% of wt activity as the thresholds to classify the variants as neutral or deleterious, respectively (12).  using this threshold, our data indicate that (a) v1534m, p1614s, e1644g, q1785h, and e1794d do not represent high-risk variants and are likely to be neutral; (b) s1655f, t1700a, g1706e, v1713a, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, l1764p, and i1766s represent deleterious/high-risk variants; (c) variants r1443g, l1546n, l1564p, l1664p, v1804d, and p1806a do not represent high-risk variants, although we cannot rule out the possibility that they may represent moderate-risk variants; and (d) variant g1788d does not represent a neutral variant, although we cannot rule out the possibility that it may represent a moderate-risk variant instead of a deleterious one.  importantly, despite variation in levels in yeast and mammalian assays, no variant presented clearly conflicting results (>80% in one test and <40% in another). these results also highlight the difficulty in relying on limited pedigree data that may suggest cosegregation with the cancer phenotype (supplementary  s1).   we also did functional tests on 14 additional variants and functionally classified six (r1443g, v1534m, d1546n, e1644g, l1664p, and p1806a) as neutral and eight (s1655f, g1706e, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, l1764p, and i1766s) as deleterious ( 4).  the v1534m classification is supported by co-occurrence data (table 2) whereas the d1546n classification is supported by clinical data, specifically from family 230 (supplementary  s1) in which at least two affected women have been shown not to carry the variant.  structural analysis is consistent with the classification of all brct variants (s1655f, l1664p, g1706e, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, l1764p, i1766s, and p1806a; table 1).  however, caution should be exercised in the classification until further evidence for these thresholds is obtained.

[21]), but this had only a very minor effect on nuclear localization.  by contrast, five different brca1 constructs (p1749r, m1775r, y1853x, 5382insc and δ1751) that contain single amino acid mutations or short deletions (including removal of only the last 11 amino acids in y1853x) within the c-terminal tandem brct domains, shifted brca1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm ( 1).  similar results were observed in t47d breast cancer cells, for both untagged and yellow fluorescent protein (yfp)-tagged versions of these constructs (data not shown).  two of the c-terminal mutations (m1775r and y1853x) that restricted nuclear localization are identical to mutations that disrupt brca1 c-terminal folding [32]( 1), suggesting that the conformational changes they elicit might be deleterious to brca1 nuclear transport.  indeed, the cytoplasmic mislocalization was specific to changes in the brct region, as more extensive c-terminal deletions had the opposite effect and caused a progressive increase in the nuclear localization of brca1 ( 1). a similar nuclear shift was observed for the n-terminal ring mutation, c61g.  in contrast, the brca1 c-terminal mutants δ1751 and y1853x remained trapped in the cytoplasm, even when nuclear export was inhibited ( 2).  these novel findings reveal that the nuclear import of the brct mutants is severely impaired.  2.   effect of blocking brca1 nuclear export on the localization of brca1 mutants c61g, δ1751 and y1853x.  graphs show the proportion of transfected mcf-7 cells showing predominantly nuclear (n), nuclear/cytoplasmic (nc), or cytoplasmic (c) brca1 (wild-type or mutant) in the presence or absence of crm1-dependent nuclear export. put more simply, we propose that brct mutations impair accessibility and function of the brca1 nls.  indeed, the strong cytoplasmic shift caused by the brct mutations y1853x, 5382insc and δ1751 was similar to that previously observed in the same system for nls-mutated brca1 [20].  the mutations did not seem to prevent the alternative ring/bard1-dependent nuclear import pathway [20], as co-expression of bard1 caused almost complete relocalization of mutant brca1 to the nucleus. as we recently observed in cells exposed to methyl methanesulfonate (34), the brct-truncated mutant brca1–5382insc failed to cluster in nuclear foci before or after ir-induced dna damage ( 2).  similarly, three other frequently studied c-terminal brct mutants, p1749r, m1775r, and y1853x, all displayed a dramatic decrease in foci localization compared with the wild-type protein.  in contrast, the n-terminal ring domain mutant c61g, which is defective for ubiquitin ligase activity (8), was only modestly reduced in its overall ability to form foci and still exhibited a potent response to ir treatment (59% of cells with >10 foci). the brct mutation in hcc1937 cells correlates with defects in g1 checkpoint activation and hyper-sensitivity to dna damage agents (21) and aberrant chromosome structure (47).  certain brca1 mutations, such as p1749r and y1853x, alter the stability and folding of the brct domain, which would interfere with brca1 binding to specific partners (48, 49).  other brct mutations such as m1775r affect surface residues but not the protein structure, thereby reducing binding affinity to bach1 (49–51).] table 1.  percentage of cells without spot in the nucleus among cells containing at least one spot straina	percentage	number of cells examined a asee the legends from figures 1c and 3d brca1	0	45 δ(1–66)	86	56 δ(1–100)	0	59 δ(1300–1863)	0	52 δ(1560–1863)	0	76 δ(1652–1863)	0	53 δ(1755–1863)	42	36 m18t	0	60 e33a	0	98 c44y	7	82 c61g	2	42 a1708e	83	59 p1749r	0	63 m1775r	2	55 y1853x	77	44 sequencing the brca1 gene from cancer-predisposed individuals and relatives uncovered large allelic variations.  in the breast cancer information core (bic) database, 1,631 different mutations were recorded to date. numbers indicate the number of times the variant was registered.  y1853x was recorded once as a nucleotide substitution 5559c>a and 12 times as a base insertion 5558_5559insa.  d dumd-brca1 database (modified march 21, 2011, http://www. +, affect the phenotype;

coyne , 2004; humphrey , 1997].  our results were consistent with these previous studies.  a1708e and y1853x cells formed colonies almost equal in size to vector cells, p1749r and m1775r cells displayed an intermediate phenotype, and m1652i cells were similar to brca1 cells ( 3b).  these results indicate that our assay behaves similarly to those employed by other laboratories. however, variability among the independent transformants of each strain was low enough in the lm assay (highlighted by the weak standard deviations,  3c) to allow statistical differences between strains, which finally lead to conclusions in agreement with those from the scp assay.  using the pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations recorded in databases (m18t, c44y, c47f, c61g, a1708e, and y1853x in table 2), sensitivity was estimated to be 83% (5/6) for each assay.  consequently, our results show that assays relying on growth, such as scp or lm assays, can be used for variants positioned in both nter and cter parts of brca1. mutations of brca1 impair the spot formation in the nucleus  we then selected eight mutations showing various effects on scp and generated cells expressing mutated brca1 fused to mcherry.  a1708e and y1853x mutations strongly decreased the proportion of cells showing one spot ( 3d).  in both cases, the proportions of cells with two spots or more became predominant ( for a1708e and  for y1853x) and most of the cells exhibited no spot in the nucleus (table 1).  the spot formation was also markedly reduced for the c61g mutation even if, contrary to a1708e and y1853x, the localization remained essentially in the nucleus.  these data, unexpected for c61g, show that single amino acid changes in the primary structure of brca1–mcherry have the same impact on the ylp as large truncations (e. first, most of the deleterious mutations located in brct, including a1708e, p1749r, and m1775r, disturb the correct folding of these domains [lee , 2010; williams , 2003].  second, the western blot results, observed for δ(1–66), δ(1755–1863), a1708e, and y1853x ( 2a and b), suggest a link between the slightly increased amount of lower molecular weight bands and the delocalized aggregation into the cytoplasm.  in these particular cases, the brca1 protein fate toward proteasomal degradation could be increased. lastly, it could provide further information concerning the biological effect of variants, beyond the deleterious/neutral classification.  thus, a1708e and y1853x induce a delocalization of brca1 in the cytoplasm, which could explain the loss of function of the brca1 nuclear protein for these deleterious variants.   c61g is a deleterious mutation. second, the deletion of the last 113 amino acids (δ(1751–1863) construct) induces a cytoplasmic mislocalization of the protein in human cells while more extensive cter deletions do not [rodriguez , 2004].  lastly, p1749r, m1775r and y1853x impair formation of nuclear foci [au and henderson, 2005], with a strong cytoplasmic mislocalization for y1853x [nelson and holt, 2010; rodriguez , 2004].  all these observations are surprisingly recapitulated in yeast, which validate the ylp assay.

2554 ||  classification of these variants into pathogenic or non-pathogenic type is an important challenge in genetic diagnosis and counseling.  the aim of the present study is to functionally assess a set of 7 missense vus (q1409l, s1473p, e1586g, r1589h, y1703s, w1718l and g1770v) located in the c-terminal region of brca1 by combining in silico prediction tools and structural analysis with a transcription activation (ta) assay.  the in silico prediction programs gave discrepant results making its interpretation difficult. structural analysis of the three variants located in the brct domains (y1703s, w1718l and g1770v) reveals significant alterations of brct structure.  the ta assay shows that variants y1703s, w1718l and g1770v dramatically compromise the transcriptional activity of brca1, while variants q1409l, s1473p, e1586g and r1589h behave like wild-type brca1.  in conclusion, our results suggest that variants y1703s, w1718l and g1770v can be classified as likely pathogenic brca1 mutations. in the work presented here, we combine a functional assay - the transcription activation (ta) assay, which is based on the function of the brca1 carboxy-terminal region (aa 1396–1863) in transcriptional activation domain when linked to a sequence-specific dna binding module - [10] with protein structural analyses [11] to assess the functional impact of seven brca1 c-terminal vus.  our results indicate that three of them (y1703s, w1718l, g1770v) have significant functional impact and may represent pathogenic brca1 variants while the remaining four do not have a functional impact.   go to: materials and methods brca1 vus  seven missense brca1 c-terminal variants (q1409l, s1473p, e1586g, r1589h, y1703s, w1718l and g1770v), identified through genetic testing of patients with suspicion of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (hbocs) as part of the hereditary cancer program of the catalan institute of oncology, were included in this study (figure 1). the structures were collected by blast-querying the pdb using the brca1 sequence (uniprot accession code p38398).  only the vus mapped in the brct tandem domains (y1703s, w1718l and g1770v) were analyzed using this approach, as there are no structural data for the upstream domain or regions.   go to: results in silico predictions  several algorithms designed to predict deleterious versus neutral missense changes were used (table 1). table 1 shows the outcomes of all methods, for comparison with high discrepancy between different programs.  the two integrative algorithms indicate that variants q1409l, s1473p, e1586g and r1589h have a benign effect and that g1770v has a damaging effect, whereas they disagree in their predictions for variants y1703s and w1718l.  furthermore the results of pon-p and condel for q1409l and g1770v strikingly diverge from those of align-gvgd, which classify q1409l as most likely to interfere with brca1 function and g1770v as less likely using the alignment from human to frog.  table 1 table 1 in silico predictions for pathogenicity of the variants presented in this study.  transcription activation assay  using the transcriptional assay, three vus (y1703s, w1718l and g1770v) showed a significant decrease in reporter expression compared to wild-type brca1 (figure 2).  the luciferase activity of these three mutants was very similar to that observed for the known pathogenic mutants used as controls: that is <5%, compared to the wild-type construct.  figure 2 figure 2 results of functional assay of the studied missense variants.  protein structural rationalizations  a structural analysis was performed for those vus located in the brct domains (y1703s, w1718l and g1770v).  y1703 is located at the brct dual-repeat-interaction interface (figure 3a), directed towards the linker. the variants selected were vus identified in a clinical scenario, which are located between amino acid residues 1,396 and 1,863 of the full-length brca1 sequence and include part of a coiled-coil domain (aa 1,364–1,437) and the brct tandem domains (aa 1,646–1,863) (figure 1).  notably, six of the vus (q1409l, s1473p, e1586g, y1703s, w1718l and g1770v) had not been recorded in the locus-specific database for mutations in brca1 and brca2, bic (breast cancer information core database, http://research. nhgri. if we tried to order the variants according to their deleteriousness as predicted from each of the algorithms, they would yield as many orders as algorithms tested.  in general terms, the two integrative programs gave quite similar results, predicting a damaging effect for one of the variants (g1770v) and a benign effect for four of them (q1409l, s1473p, e1586g and r1589h), while variants y1703s and w1718l were difficult to classify.  therefore, attending to the results obtained in this study, we consider the use of in silico programs not reliable enough to get an approximation of the pathogenicity of a given vus. in this study two constructs containing previously classified pathogenic variants (iarc class 5), m1775r and y1853x, were used as negative controls and a construct with the wild-type brca1 c-terminal region was used as a positive control.  this assay clearly identified a functional defect for three of the variants (y1703s, w1718l and g1770v), whereas the remaining variants gave results very similar to those of the wild-type controls.  it should be noted that residue w1718 appears to be highly prone to mutation, and although the mutation studied here has never been reported, mutations w1718s and w1718c have been described in hbocs families; in addition, a panel of assays including protease sensitivity, phosphopeptide binding activity and specificity, as well as the ta assay, revealed that both of these variants have strong functional effects [28].  in summary, in a clinical context, extensive worldwide analysis of brca1 has identified a large number of vus, most of them unique, which need to be classified for the purposes of diagnosis and genetic counseling.  by combining functional analysis and structural rationalizations, this study shows that three brca1 vus (y1703s, w1718l and g1770v) have profound functional impact and may be pathogenic variants.  by contrast, the other four variants did not alter the function of brca1 in the ta assay and should remain classified as vus.
2555 ||  in an attempt to clarify the functional importance of the brca1 cterminus as a transcription activator in cancer predisposition, we have characterized the effect of c-terminal germ-line variants identified in scandinavian breast and ovarian cancer families.  missense variants a1669s, c1697r, r1699w, r1699q, a1708e, s1715r, g1738e and a truncating mutation, w1837x, were characterized using yeast- and mammalian-based transcription assays.  in addition, four additional missense variants (v1665m, d1692n, s1715n, and d1733g) and one in-frame deletion (v1688del) were included in the study. results were comparable in both yeast strains in a semi-quantitative assay (table 1).  analysis of variants identified in lund families variants a1669s, r1699w and r1699q, displayed wild-type activity suggesting that they represent benign polymorphisms (table 1).  for variant a1669s, the data from functional assays are in agreement with the pedigree analysis (figure 2). one of the affected family members did not carry the mutation and cases of uterine and very early onset ovarian cancer indicate involvement of predisposing genes other than brca1 or brca2.  additional clinical data should provide insight regarding a1669s and will serve as measurement of the prediction provided by the assay.  interestingly, pedigree analysis seemed to indicate that the r1699w is a cancer-predisposing allele (figure 2, lund 279).

table 1). we then carried out an analysis using interspecific variation, pedigree analysis, and co-occurrence data (table 1).  of the seven variants for which the method based on interspecific variation was able to reach a conclusion, the data confirmed the classification based on our functional tests in six cases (l1407p, h1402y, t1685i, g1706a, g1788v, and w1837r) but presented a contradiction for variant m1628v.  the pedigree analysis confirmed our results for brca bilat 42 m brca 29 m brca 35 m brca 55 m prophylactic mastectomy lund 897 m = v1809f 1 brca 41 brca 66 brca 55 brca 44 wt m wt wt m brca 54 brca 51 cl-8 m = t1720a 3 brca 81 brca 85 wt f92 m = t1720a brca 55 brca 44 m brca 40 m wt brca 48 brca 49 ov 54 t334 m = m1628t brca 52 brca? 52 m wt wt m wt m m m m wt wt wt m 6-99-006 m = g1706a 2 brca65 br 44-54 brca 87 ov 45 brca 53 m792 m = w1837r othca 70 (colon?) prostate leukaemia? 78 m brca 40? sto cns? 42 brca 39 homcs 57 ovarian disgerminoma 27 m ovcs 58 bladder 53 wt brca 52 wt brca > 70? figure 3 pedigrees of missense variants in brca1.com three the four variants analysed.  results from pedigree analysis for w1837r contradicted all the other methods, although the odds against causality were rather small.  interestingly, results for g1706a suggested again that the available information is not enough to classify it.40 segregates with disease. 14 clinical data favour classification as deleterious mutation;

however, given that fact that pedigree analysis, transcriptional activation, and protease sensitivity indicate a high risk variant, our conclusion is that, although the change is a conservative one, the side chain size threshold in the algorithm needs to be refined.  in summary, we have classified six missense variants (l1407p, m1628v, t1685i, a1752p, g1788v, and v1809f) as probable deleterious/high risk variants and the remainder as probable neutral/low clinical significance variants (h1402y, h1421y, s1512i, m1628t, and t1720a), with two variants (g1706a and w1837r) left unclassified.  previously, all the known deleterious missense changes were in the ring domain or brct repeats.
2557 ||  these mutations are likely to affect the interactions between helices α1 and α3 thereby destabilising brct domain structure.  two other missense mutations in the brct-c domain, p1806a and v1833e were shown, respectively, to display wildtype activity and to abolish transcription activation (table 1 and and3). 3).  interestingly, p1806a is predicted to have no obvious effect on the structure while a less drastic mutation at position v1833 (to methionine) has been predicted to destabilise the fold of the domain (36) suggesting that v1833e will behave similarly.   pentapeptide insertions in many of the predicted secondary structure elements in the c-terminal region of brca1 abolish transcription activation (table 1 and  3).
2558 ||  seven mutations at five positions display an scp similar to wild type brca1.  all but one (v1653m) alter residues incompletely conserved between the orthologs of eight vertebrate species and, in fact, three result in substitution of a residue allowed in another species at the corresponding position (t1720i, v1804a, p1806a).  with one exception (v1804d49), the scp assay predictions for these alleles are consistent with all other available predictions. this confirmation of the potential value of the scp assay highlights the need to understand its biochemical basis.  this understanding table 1 mutations characterized in this study secondary structure, predicted structural references for functional mutation allowed residues* detected in humans consequences predictions upstream of brct l1600e l n unknown k1601e k n “ lk1600/01ee lk n “ k1606e q, k, r y “ a1608v a, e y “ s1613c s, n y “ 40 a1615d a n “ m1628v m, s, v, r y “ m1628t m, s, v, r y “ p1637l p y “ 42 a164it a, s y “ brct region m1652t m, i, f y adjacent to β sheet 1, brct-n 32, 40#, 50 m1652k m, i, f n “ 32, 38, 40#, 49, 50 v1653m v y “ 49, 50 s1655f s y “ 50 t1720a t, v, i y α helix 3, brct-n 38#, 49, 50 t1720i t, v, i n “ 38#, 49, 50 v1736a v y between brct domains 38#, 49 d1739e d y “ 49 d1739g d y “ 49, 50 m1775r m y α helix 1, brct-c/ 31-34, 36, 37, 40, 49, 51 surface, disrupts interface m1783t m, i y α helix 1, brct-c/ 34, 49-51 intrahelical, destabilizes fold g1788v g y loop between α helix 1 32, 34, 44#, 49-51 and β sheet 2, brct-c, incorrect folding v1804a v, t, a, s n loop between β 51 sheets 2 and 3, brct-c v1804d v, t, a, s y “ 49-51 p1806a p, l, a, s y “ 38, 49, 50 v1808a v y β sheet 3, brct-c, 34, 49-51 destabilizes fold v1810g v y “ 49, 50 n1819y n, s, a, t, r n α helix 2, brct-c 49, 51 v1833m v y β sheet 4, brct-c, 34, 38#, 49-51 destabilizes fold y1853x y y 11 residue truncation those italicized and underlined abrogate the small colony phenotype, and thus are predicted to negatively affect brca1 structure and/or function.  *upstream of brct: allowed residues in mammals;

(b) s1655f, t1700a, g1706e, v1713a, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, l1764p, and i1766s represent deleterious/high-risk variants; (c) variants r1443g, l1546n, l1564p, l1664p, v1804d, and p1806a do not represent high-risk variants, although we cannot rule out the possibility that they may represent moderate-risk variants; and (d) variant g1788d does not represent a neutral variant, although we cannot rule out the possibility that it may represent a moderate-risk variant instead of a deleterious one.  importantly, despite variation in levels in yeast and mammalian assays, no variant presented clearly conflicting results (>80% in one test and <40% in another). these results also highlight the difficulty in relying on limited pedigree data that may suggest cosegregation with the cancer phenotype (supplementary  s1).   we also did functional tests on 14 additional variants and functionally classified six (r1443g, v1534m, d1546n, e1644g, l1664p, and p1806a) as neutral and eight (s1655f, g1706e, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, l1764p, and i1766s) as deleterious ( 4).  the v1534m classification is supported by co-occurrence data (table 2) whereas the d1546n classification is supported by clinical data, specifically from family 230 (supplementary  s1) in which at least two affected women have been shown not to carry the variant.  structural analysis is consistent with the classification of all brct variants (s1655f, l1664p, g1706e, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, l1764p, i1766s, and p1806a;

2559 ||   eight other substitution mutants were tested for function in the homologous recombination pathway.  the m18t and t37r variants did not complement the hdr assay.  variants that could complement the hdr activity were i21v, i31m, i42v, l52, d67y, and r71g. these are the same proteins that functioned in homologous recombination.  of note, the brca1 variant proteins m18t and h41r had detectable low level of bard1 binding, but these brca1 variants did not complement the hdr assay.   figure 5 figure 5 effect of brca1 missense variants on association with bard1 correlation of biological function with available clinical data for each brca1 missense mutant  we have summarized the available information for each mutant in table 1, including results of hdr function and bard1 binding (this study), e3 ubiquitin ligase activity and resistance to ionizing radiation (6), and available clinical information. one other variant, r71g, has been classified as deleterious (2, 20), and one, d67y, had been classified as neutral (4).  one of the substitution mutants, m18t, has a published odds ratio of being deleterious of 31:1 (4).  using vus predict, the m18t mutant has :1 odds of being deleterious.  while these analyses clearly indicate the m18t variant has a trend as a deleterious allele, the magnitude of the ratio did not exceed the threshold of 1000:1 for making a clinical classification.  we find that this mutation of brca1 causes a complete loss of hdr activity. though this substitution, when expressed in a truncated brca1 peptide in the absence of the bard1 did have ubiquitin ligase enzymatic activity, it was defective in protection of a cell against ionizing radiation (6).  in another study using the brca1/bard1 heterodimer, the m18t variant was inactive as a ubiquitin ligase (21).  the m18t substitution could affect the brca1-bard1 heterodimerization interface (22), resulting in reduced bard1 association with the brca1 variant (figure 5). most variants that showed less than wild-type activity in the proliferation assay also scored as functionally impaired in the cisplatin sensitivity assay and were classifi ed as deleterious ( table 1 ,  table 1.    functional classifi cation of brca1 vus based on cisplatin response variant dna change type of mutation a classifi cation s4f 11c>t vus not clear m18t 53t>c vus deleterious 185delag 68_69delag deleterious control deleterious b k45q 133a>c vus neutral c61g 181t>g deleterious control deleterious c64g 190t>g vus deleterious b d67y 199g>t vus neutral y105c 314a>g neutral control neutral n132k 396c>a vus neutral p142h 425c>a vus neutral l147f 441g>c vus neutral l165p 494t>c vus neutral r170w 508c>t vus neutral s186y 557c>a vus neutral v191i 571g>a vus neutral t231m 692c>t vus neutral d245v 734a>t vus neutral l246v 736t>g vus neutral v271l 811g>c vus neutral s308a 922a>g;

coyne , 2004; humphrey , 1997].  our results were consistent with these previous studies. however, variability among the independent transformants of each strain was low enough in the lm assay (highlighted by the weak standard deviations,  3c) to allow statistical differences between strains, which finally lead to conclusions in agreement with those from the scp assay.  using the pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations recorded in databases (m18t, c44y, c47f, c61g, a1708e, and y1853x in table 2), sensitivity was estimated to be 83% (5/6) for each assay.  consequently, our results show that assays relying on growth, such as scp or lm assays, can be used for variants positioned in both nter and cter parts of brca1., δ(1300–1863) in  1c).  a mild but significant decrease of cells showing one spot was also observed for m18t, e33a, c44y, p1749r, and m1775r mutations.  we therefore conclude first that the ylp assay is efficient in assessing missense mutations located in nter and cter ends of brca1. second, the ylp assay provides qualitative information about the impact of such mutations on brca1 nuclear localization.  some variants, such as m18t, decrease the brca1 aggregation, which remains localized in the nucleus.  others, such as a1708e, have a more pronounced effect, with brca1 aggregation taking place essentially in the cytoplasm (sup  s7). from this, we conclude that c61g is an unusual case and that yeast growth assays are not restricted to the cter part of brca1.  four variants among the seven tested are classified as pathogenic by genetic methods (c44y, c47f, and c61g in the umd-brca1 database, and m18t, c44y, and c61g in the lovd-iarc database, see table 2).  we thus estimate the scp assay sensitivity in the ring domain to 3/4.

these are the only known carcinogenic mutations of brca1 which are in contact with residues with p53 in our modeled complex.  interestingly, f1695 and d1733 are not conserved between brca1 and 53bp1, whilst n1730 and f1734 are conserved. this result is consistent with our expectation that eliminating positive charge repulsion in α3a region can stabilize the brca1-p53 interface.   at the α4a region, the complexes of d1733r and d1733g mutants with wild type p53 were simulated.  unsurprisingly, both mutants stabilize the interface, as shown in figure 5 (middle, left). the more negative the δδg, the stronger the brca1-p53 binding it implies; and, smaller values of the rmsd of the complex interface suggest more stable interface.  comparing to wild type brca1, mutants f1695l and d1733g have the most negative δδg, suggesting stronger binding with p53 than the wild type brca1 in this orientation.  in addition, these two mutants have the smallest average rmsd values. interestingly, these two mutants are the only cancer-related mutants among all the mutants simulated according to the national human genome research institute (nhgri) breast cancer mutation database.  considering that the binding energy of f1695l mutants with p53 is more negative and the average rmsd value is smaller than d1733g, we predict that among these thirteen mutants, f1695l could be the mutant candidate to most stabilize the interface of brca1-p53 complex in the conformation similar to the 53bp1-p53 complex.   table 1 table 1 comparison of the binding energy and interface average cα rmsd for brca1 mutants bound to p53. thus the prediction that the f1695l mutation stabilizes the brca1-p53 complex may provide some insight into the association and its role in breast cancer.  d1733g, another cancer associated mutant, also stabilizes the complex interface to some degree because it avoids attracting a positively charged residue from the brca1 loop region thus preventing accumulation of positive charge around the p53 l3 loo taken together, by stabilizing the unwanted interactions, the p53 binds brca1 in a way similar to the p53-53bp1 binding pattern, thus falling into a “similarity trap”.  that is, the two carcinogenic mutants strongly disturbed the native functions. two of these four, n1730 and f1734 are conserved between brca1 and 53bp1, and two f1695 and d1733 are not conserved.  interestingly, it is the two non-conserved carcinogenic mutants, f1695l and d1733g, which enforced the binding of p53 core domain with brca1-brct domain in a way similar to that with 53bp1 protein.  therefore, we propose that the known binding pattern in p53-53bp1 interaction is a “similarity trap” that nature has to avoid in the p53-brca1 interactions. missense variants a1669s, c1697r, r1699w, r1699q, a1708e, s1715r, g1738e and a truncating mutation, w1837x, were characterized using yeast- and mammalian-based transcription assays.  in addition, four additional missense variants (v1665m, d1692n, s1715n, and d1733g) and one in-frame deletion (v1688del) were included in the study.  our findings demonstrate that transactivation activity may reflect a tumor suppressing function of brca1 and further support the role of brca1 missense mutations in disease predisposition. these findings strengthen the correlation between disease-predisposition and predictions made by the transcription assay (24).  analysis of variants in the bic database variants v1665m, d1692n and d1733g displayed wild-type activity suggesting that they represent benign polymorphisms (table 1).  the v1665m variant affects a residue close to a1669, in the predicted brct conformation (29), which also displayed wild-type activity (table 1 and figure 3) suggesting that this small stretch is tolerant to mutations. author manuscript author manuscript author manuscript author manuscript transactivation activity suggesting that the predicted salt bridge is not important for the transactivation ability of brca1 (table 1 and figure 3).  the d1733g variant is a conserved acidic residue located in the brct-n/brct-c interval.  however, more information is still needed for a reliable characterization of this variant. author manuscript author manuscript author manuscript author manuscript considering the excellent correspondence between genetic alterations associated with breast and ovarian cancer in families and those that abolish transactivation, we tentatively characterized several additional brca1 unclassified variants.  we propose that variants v1665m, d1692n, and d1733g represent benign polymorphisms and variants v1668del and s1715n represent disease-associated mutations.  final characterization of these variants must await independent confirmation.

(b) s1655f, t1700a, g1706e, v1713a, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, l1764p, and i1766s represent deleterious/high-risk variants; (c) variants r1443g, l1546n, l1564p, l1664p, v1804d, and p1806a do not represent high-risk variants, although we cannot rule out the possibility that they may represent moderate-risk variants; and (d) variant g1788d does not represent a neutral variant, although we cannot rule out the possibility that it may represent a moderate-risk variant instead of a deleterious one.  importantly, despite variation in levels in yeast and mammalian assays, no variant presented clearly conflicting results (>80% in one test and <40% in another). these results also highlight the difficulty in relying on limited pedigree data that may suggest cosegregation with the cancer phenotype (supplementary  s1).   we also did functional tests on 14 additional variants and functionally classified six (r1443g, v1534m, d1546n, e1644g, l1664p, and p1806a) as neutral and eight (s1655f, g1706e, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, l1764p, and i1766s) as deleterious ( 4).  the v1534m classification is supported by co-occurrence data (table 2) whereas the d1546n classification is supported by clinical data, specifically from family 230 (supplementary  s1) in which at least two affected women have been shown not to carry the variant.  structural analysis is consistent with the classification of all brct variants (s1655f, l1664p, g1706e, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, l1764p, i1766s, and p1806a; table 1).  however, caution should be exercised in the classification until further evidence for these thresholds is obtained.
2575 ||  in this assay, yeast transformed with pad–brca1–δ2 modified by v1713a formed easily visible colonies comparable in size and number of cells per colony to m1775r and p1749r cancer-predisposing controls ( (33c), suggesting that v1713a inactivates a function that protects against cancer and is consistent with detection of this sequence change in the germline of an individual with a high probability of hereditary breast–ovarian cancer.   p1637l, like v1713a, was detected in the germline and tumor dna of an individual with early onset ovarian cancer from a family with a history of breast and ovarian cancer (23).  this sequence change alters a conserved residue (11) and was not detected in 162 control chromosomes (23). accordingly, the p1637l sequence change was reported as a cancer-associated mutation.  however, subsequent to publication, additional sequence analysis revealed a frameshift mutation (nucleotide 2575delc) present in the same allele as p1637l (ref.  27; a. futreal, personal communication).  a second chromosome from an unrelated patient also has been discovered to contain both the frameshift mutation and p1637l, implying that p1637l is a rare polymorphism in linkage disequilibrium with the 2575delc frameshift mutation (ref.  27; a. futreal, personal communication).  modification of pad–brca1–δ2 by p1637l had no effect on the formation of small colonies ( (33 b and c), consistent with evidence that this sequence change is a rare polymorphism.   we sought to correlate our results with an alternate yeast assay of brca1 activity (13).
2576 ||  of note, there was in general good correlation between our classifi cation and the align-gvgd score (supplementary table s4).  notable exceptions were the neutral control variant r866c, which validated our assay but scored as likely deleterious (c65) using align-gvgd, and g1770v, which scored as likely neutral (c0) by align-gvgd but was classi- fi ed as deleterious in our assay.  our assay also classifi ed some variants for which the align-gvgd scores were less clear, emphasizing the usefulness of functional assays to complement in silico analysis. although hr is essentially error-free, nhej is error-prone, and therefore defects in hr are known to lead to genomic instability.  although it is not clear whether other variant dna change type of mutation a classifi cation v1736a 5207t>c

value.  it is known that brca1- and brca2- defi cient cells are extremely sensitive to parp1 inhibition ( 28, 29 ), leading to a larger dynamic range between brca2- defi cient cells and isogenic brca2-profi cient controls than for cisplatin ( 30 ). classification of these variants into pathogenic or non-pathogenic type is an important challenge in genetic diagnosis and counseling.  the aim of the present study is to functionally assess a set of 7 missense vus (q1409l, s1473p, e1586g, r1589h, y1703s, w1718l and g1770v) located in the c-terminal region of brca1 by combining in silico prediction tools and structural analysis with a transcription activation (ta) assay.  the in silico prediction programs gave discrepant results making its interpretation difficult. structural analysis of the three variants located in the brct domains (y1703s, w1718l and g1770v) reveals significant alterations of brct structure.  the ta assay shows that variants y1703s, w1718l and g1770v dramatically compromise the transcriptional activity of brca1, while variants q1409l, s1473p, e1586g and r1589h behave like wild-type brca1.  in conclusion, our results suggest that variants y1703s, w1718l and g1770v can be classified as likely pathogenic brca1 mutations. in the work presented here, we combine a functional assay - the transcription activation (ta) assay, which is based on the function of the brca1 carboxy-terminal region (aa 1396–1863) in transcriptional activation domain when linked to a sequence-specific dna binding module - [10] with protein structural analyses [11] to assess the functional impact of seven brca1 c-terminal vus.  our results indicate that three of them (y1703s, w1718l, g1770v) have significant functional impact and may represent pathogenic brca1 variants while the remaining four do not have a functional impact.   go to: materials and methods brca1 vus  seven missense brca1 c-terminal variants (q1409l, s1473p, e1586g, r1589h, y1703s, w1718l and g1770v), identified through genetic testing of patients with suspicion of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (hbocs) as part of the hereditary cancer program of the catalan institute of oncology, were included in this study (figure 1). the structures were collected by blast-querying the pdb using the brca1 sequence (uniprot accession code p38398).  only the vus mapped in the brct tandem domains (y1703s, w1718l and g1770v) were analyzed using this approach, as there are no structural data for the upstream domain or regions.   go to: results in silico predictions  several algorithms designed to predict deleterious versus neutral missense changes were used (table 1). table 1 shows the outcomes of all methods, for comparison with high discrepancy between different programs.  the two integrative algorithms indicate that variants q1409l, s1473p, e1586g and r1589h have a benign effect and that g1770v has a damaging effect, whereas they disagree in their predictions for variants y1703s and w1718l.  furthermore the results of pon-p and condel for q1409l and g1770v strikingly diverge from those of align-gvgd, which classify q1409l as most likely to interfere with brca1 function and g1770v as less likely using the alignment from human to frog.  table 1 table 1 in silico predictions for pathogenicity of the variants presented in this study.  transcription activation assay  using the transcriptional assay, three vus (y1703s, w1718l and g1770v) showed a significant decrease in reporter expression compared to wild-type brca1 (figure 2).  the luciferase activity of these three mutants was very similar to that observed for the known pathogenic mutants used as controls: that is <5%, compared to the wild-type construct.  figure 2 figure 2 results of functional assay of the studied missense variants.  protein structural rationalizations  a structural analysis was performed for those vus located in the brct domains (y1703s, w1718l and g1770v).  y1703 is located at the brct dual-repeat-interaction interface (figure 3a), directed towards the linker. the variants selected were vus identified in a clinical scenario, which are located between amino acid residues 1,396 and 1,863 of the full-length brca1 sequence and include part of a coiled-coil domain (aa 1,364–1,437) and the brct tandem domains (aa 1,646–1,863) (figure 1).  notably, six of the vus (q1409l, s1473p, e1586g, y1703s, w1718l and g1770v) had not been recorded in the locus-specific database for mutations in brca1 and brca2, bic (breast cancer information core database, http://research. nhgri. if we tried to order the variants according to their deleteriousness as predicted from each of the algorithms, they would yield as many orders as algorithms tested.  in general terms, the two integrative programs gave quite similar results, predicting a damaging effect for one of the variants (g1770v) and a benign effect for four of them (q1409l, s1473p, e1586g and r1589h), while variants y1703s and w1718l were difficult to classify.  therefore, attending to the results obtained in this study, we consider the use of in silico programs not reliable enough to get an approximation of the pathogenicity of a given vus. in this study two constructs containing previously classified pathogenic variants (iarc class 5), m1775r and y1853x, were used as negative controls and a construct with the wild-type brca1 c-terminal region was used as a positive control.  this assay clearly identified a functional defect for three of the variants (y1703s, w1718l and g1770v), whereas the remaining variants gave results very similar to those of the wild-type controls.  it should be noted that residue w1718 appears to be highly prone to mutation, and although the mutation studied here has never been reported, mutations w1718s and w1718c have been described in hbocs families; in addition, a panel of assays including protease sensitivity, phosphopeptide binding activity and specificity, as well as the ta assay, revealed that both of these variants have strong functional effects [28]. in spite of this, and due to the fact that mutation q1409l is mapped in the brca1/palb2 interaction region, it would be worth to test if mutant l1409 is hampering the brca1/palb2 interaction [30].  moreover, mutation g1770v, which shows a clear impairment of ta activity, has been found in two families of moroccan origin presumed to be independent.  in both cases, patients suffer from breast or ovarian cancer at a very early age of onset (27 and 30 years of age, respectively).  in summary, in a clinical context, extensive worldwide analysis of brca1 has identified a large number of vus, most of them unique, which need to be classified for the purposes of diagnosis and genetic counseling.  by combining functional analysis and structural rationalizations, this study shows that three brca1 vus (y1703s, w1718l and g1770v) have profound functional impact and may be pathogenic variants.  by contrast, the other four variants did not alter the function of brca1 in the ta assay and should remain classified as vus.
2578 ||  in addition, we have included three additional mutants in this group that show poor agreement between the different assays but are likely to directly affect the peptide-binding surface.  s1655f is predicted to impede recognition of the phosphoserine in the bound peptide, whereas g1656d could perturb the structure of the phosphoserine-binding pocket, and the introduction of a negatively charged side chain in this region would be expected to further inhibit phosphopeptide recognition.  r1699l would remove a critical determinant for recognition of the phenylalanine residue at the +3 position of the phosphopeptide, and indeed, the similar r1699w variant is pathogenic (iarc class 5; table 1).
2580 ||  the m18t and t37r variants did not complement the hdr assay.  variants that could complement the hdr activity were i21v, i31m, i42v, l52, d67y, and r71g.   we tested whether the mutant brca1 proteins used in this study could bind to bard1 (figure 5). purified proteins were analyzed by immunoblots specific for the ha-epitope to evaluate the effectiveness of expression and purification of the mutant brca1 protein and specific for the endogenous bard1 protein.  we found that brca1 variant proteins i21v, i31m, i42v, l52f, d67y, and r71g effectively purified cellular bard1 protein.  these are the same proteins that functioned in homologous recombination.

2583 ||  for the remaining three exposed mutations that abolish transcription, we propose that they disrupt interactions with brca1 ligand(s).  they are located in a groove formed by both brct repeats (l1657p and k1702e) and in the ridge that delimits the groove (e1660g).  we suggest that this clustering of residues in a single patch on the surface of brca1 highlights a binding site with integrity that is necessary for transcription.
2584 ||  in an attempt to clarify the functional importance of the brca1 cterminus as a transcription activator in cancer predisposition, we have characterized the effect of c-terminal germ-line variants identified in scandinavian breast and ovarian cancer families.  missense variants a1669s, c1697r, r1699w, r1699q, a1708e, s1715r, g1738e and a truncating mutation, w1837x, were characterized using yeast- and mammalian-based transcription assays.  in addition, four additional missense variants (v1665m, d1692n, s1715n, and d1733g) and one in-frame deletion (v1688del) were included in the study. our result is in agreement with pedigree analysis in which the mutation segregates with the disease (figure 2, lund 190).  variants c1697r, a1708e, s1715r and g1738e displayed loss of activity suggesting that they represent disease-associated mutations (table 1), an observation in agreement with pedigree analysis for mutations c1697r, a1708e and s1715r (figure 2).  the amino acid substitution c1697r is a rather dramatic one, from a nonpolar residue capable of forming disulfide linkages to a positively charged residue, located in a critical α-helix based on the structure of xrcc1 brct (29). s1715 is an evolutionarily conserved residue.  however, the disease pattern in lund 184 (harboring a s1715r substitution; variant s1715n was also analyzed, see below) is not satisfactorily explained by a mutation in brca1 alone because it presents an uncharacteristic phenotype.  multiple cases of colon cancer might suggest the involvement of a mismatch repair gene defect. previous mutation analysis has underscored the importance of hydrophobic residues for the function of brca1 (24).  similar to s1715r (lund 184) the substitution s1715n (bic) resulted in loss of activity in the assay.  fusion protein and promoter stringency do not influence assay outcome to rule out the possibility that the results obtained with the gal4 dbd fusions were dependent on the dna binding domain, we also performed the experiments using fusions to lexa dbd in the saccharomyces cerevisiae strain egy48 (24).
2586 ||  it was shown that the transcriptional activation assay could be used as a test to characterise mutations in the carboxy-terminus region of brca1 encompassing residues 1396–1863.  thirteen missense variants (h1402y, l1407p, h1421y, s1512i, m1628t, m1628v, t1685i, g1706a, t1720a, a1752p, g1788v, v1809f, and w1837r) were specifically investigated.  conclusions: while individual classification schemes for brca1 alleles still present limitations, a combination of several methods provides a more powerful way of identifying variants that are causally linked to a high risk of breast and ovarian cancer. along those lines, we hypothesised that unclassified missense variants located in regions of brca1 that contribute to transcription activation besides the brct domains might be amenable to a transcription based classification.  in the present study we show that the transcriptional activation assay can be used as a test to characterise mutations in the region encompassing aa 1396–1863 (exons 13 to 24) and we specifically investigated 13 missense variants (h1402y, l1407p, h1421y, s1512i, m1628t, m1628v, t1685i, g1706a, t1720a, a1752p, g1788v, v1809f, and w1837r).  in addition, we analysed all the mutations using a prediction algorithm based on interspecific sequence variation and grantham matrices. dpn1 was subsequently added to digest the parental plasmid leaving only cdnas with the introduced mutations to be transformed into bacteria.  mutations h1421y, s1512i, p1614s, m1628t, m1628v, t1685i, t1700a, t1720a, g1788v, v1809f, and w1837r were introduced using splicing by overlapping extension pcr. 26 the first round of pcr was undertaken using the following primers: h1421y 39 region (h1421y-u2, 59 gttagaacag tatgggagccagccttct;

ux13). all were at a frequency of 0/500.  the remaining variants were assessed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) with the following frequencies: h1402y (0/500), l1407p (0/500), h1421y (0/500), s1512i (6/500), s1613g (260/500), m1628v (0/500), m1628t (0/500), t1685i (0/500), w1837r (0/500), and y1853x (0/500).  variants t1720a and v1809f were not assessed. the intermediate results for these mutants suggest that they may represent moderate rather than high risk variants.  six additional variants (h1402y, l1407p, h1421y, s1512i, m1628t, and m1628v) in locations outside the brct domains were also investigated for their effect on transcription.  three of the variants were located in a region in which a putative coiled coil domain has been predicted to form (fig 2a). it also confirms our functional results for h1402y, l1407p, t1685i, g1706a, g1788v, and w1837r.  variant m1628v, however, was classified as a neutral/low risk variant in contradiction of our functional results.  the remaining variants could not be classified by this method. once it was verified that the extended assay assigned positive and negative controls correctly, seven missense variants in the brct domain and six variants outside the brct domain were tested (fig 2).  the variants were chosen because they were identified as the sole brca1 alteration in individuals considered to be at high risk for breast or ovarian cancer (s1512i, m1628v, m1628t, t1685i, g1706a, t1720a, a1752p, g1788v, v1809f, and w1837r) or were located at or in close proximity to the putative coiled-coil domain (h1402y, l1407p, and h1421y).  seven of the variants caused a dramatic loss of the transcription activation function (l1407p, m1628v, t1685i, a1752p, g1788v, v1809f, and w1837r), similar to known high risk mutation controls, suggesting that they may constitute deleterious/high risk variants (fig 2b and 2c; table 1). we then carried out an analysis using interspecific variation, pedigree analysis, and co-occurrence data (table 1).  of the seven variants for which the method based on interspecific variation was able to reach a conclusion, the data confirmed the classification based on our functional tests in six cases (l1407p, h1402y, t1685i, g1706a, g1788v, and w1837r) but presented a contradiction for variant m1628v.  the pedigree analysis confirmed our results for brca bilat 42 m brca 29 m brca 35 m brca 55 m prophylactic mastectomy lund 897 m = v1809f 1 brca 41 brca 66 brca 55 brca 44 wt m wt wt m brca 54 brca 51 cl-8 m = t1720a 3 brca 81 brca 85 wt f92 m = t1720a brca 55 brca 44 m brca 40 m wt brca 48 brca 49 ov 54 t334 m = m1628t brca 52 brca? 52 m wt wt m wt m m m m wt wt wt m 6-99-006 m = g1706a 2 brca65 br 44-54 brca 87 ov 45 brca 53 m792 m = w1837r othca 70 (colon?) prostate leukaemia? 78 m brca 40? sto cns? 42 brca 39 homcs 57 ovarian disgerminoma 27 m ovcs 58 bladder 53 wt brca 52 wt brca > 70? figure 3 pedigrees of missense variants in brca1. in order to further cross validate our analysis we compared it with results from three published methods to classify variants in the brct domain (table 1).  the first method is table 1 comprehensive analysis of brca1 variants exon mutation nucleotide change* allowed residues  txn` iv1 pdg ps** st   bic`` co11 comments 13 h1402y c4323t hdynk # # nd na na 1 1 reduces the probability to form coiled coil   structure from  to  13 l1407p t4339c l n ? nd na na 1 0 conserved stretch;

however, given that fact that pedigree analysis, transcriptional activation, and protease sensitivity indicate a high risk variant, our conclusion is that, although the change is a conservative one, the side chain size threshold in the algorithm needs to be refined.  in summary, we have classified six missense variants (l1407p, m1628v, t1685i, a1752p, g1788v, and v1809f) as probable deleterious/high risk variants and the remainder as probable neutral/low clinical significance variants (h1402y, h1421y, s1512i, m1628t, and t1720a), with two variants (g1706a and w1837r) left unclassified.  previously, all the known deleterious missense changes were in the ring domain or brct repeats.  although further work is needed to classify variants l1407p and m1628v unambiguously, our results provide evidence that other regions or motifs are likely to harbour high risk missense substitutions.  in particular, classification of l1407p as a high risk variant suggests an important function for the putative coiled coil motif as previously suggested.

table 1).  we predict a given variant to be neutral when each of the assays gives values similar to wild-type within the limits defined by comparison with the set of variants that have been characterized through family history and genetic data. for example, variants that are moderately well folded based on proteolytic stability can often be purified and studied in more detail.  circular dicroism spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry have been used to quantitatively assess the fold stability of v1696l, r1699w, m1775k, m1775r, m1783t, v1808a, v1809f, and v1833m (49–51).  although our proteolytic assay indicated that the stability of two of these variants, r1699w and v1808a, were indistinguishable from wild-type, the more sensitive thermodynamic studies of the purified forms of these variants reveal a small but significant reduction in fold stability. in an attempt to clarify the functional importance of the brca1 cterminus as a transcription activator in cancer predisposition, we have characterized the effect of c-terminal germ-line variants identified in scandinavian breast and ovarian cancer families.  missense variants a1669s, c1697r, r1699w, r1699q, a1708e, s1715r, g1738e and a truncating mutation, w1837x, were characterized using yeast- and mammalian-based transcription assays.  in addition, four additional missense variants (v1665m, d1692n, s1715n, and d1733g) and one in-frame deletion (v1688del) were included in the study. results were comparable in both yeast strains in a semi-quantitative assay (table 1).  analysis of variants identified in lund families variants a1669s, r1699w and r1699q, displayed wild-type activity suggesting that they represent benign polymorphisms (table 1).  for variant a1669s, the data from functional assays are in agreement with the pedigree analysis (figure 2). additional clinical data should provide insight regarding a1669s and will serve as measurement of the prediction provided by the assay.  interestingly, pedigree analysis seemed to indicate that the r1699w is a cancer-predisposing allele (figure 2, lund 279).  disease association is further emphasized by other findings where r1699w was found in a large pedigree in which several women, through three generations and across four degrees of relatedness, diagnosed with ovarian cancer carried the variant (frank ts and scalia j, manuscript in preparation). the reporter genes used in the yeast experiments contain multiple binding sites in their promoters (8 for lexa; 4 for gal4) raising the possibility that variants with partial loss of function could score as wild type in the semi-quantitative filter β-galactosidase assay.  this could be particularly important in the case of r1699w variant for which we found a contradiction between the family data and transcription activity.  therefore, egy48 experiments with the r1699w variant were performed with the lacz reporter under control of one, two or eight lexa operators (32).  in all cases, r1699w was indistinguishable from the wild-type allele (not shown).  quantitative assessment of transcription activation despite the fact that we saw no difference that could be attributed to promoter stringency, it was still possible that variants with partial loss of activity could only be differentiated using quantitative liquid β-galactosidase assay. however, results were comparable to the semiquantitative assays (figure 3a and table 1).  interestingly, r1699w was approximately twofold more active than the wild-type control.  in conclusion, the contradiction found for variant r1699w was not due to a partial loss of function undistinguishable from the wild type in semi-quantitative assays. analysis in mammalian cells to further examine the transcription activity of the variants we performed assays in mammalian cells.  with the exception of variants r1699w and r1699q, transcription activation was comparable between yeast and mammalian cells (figure 3a,b).  in 293t cells, variants r1699w and r1699q displayed loss of function phenotype in accordance with pedigree analysis, suggesting that these variants are indeed cancer-associated vallon-christersson  page 5 hum mol genet. author manuscript author manuscript author manuscript author manuscript mutations.  protein levels of r1699w and wild type were similar ruling out increased instability of the protein as the cause for the loss of function phenotype (figure 3c).  discussion the notion that cancer-predisposing mutations in tumor suppressor genes cause a loss-offunction phenotype is a key concept in cancer genetics. this is exemplified by the r1699 variants (table 1).  while the clinical data indicates that r1699w is likely to predispose carriers to ovarian cancer (figure 2) our yeast-based tests revealed a wild-type activity, an apparent divergence between disease predisposition in vivo and the transcription activation assay (table 1).  this disagreement could not be explained by vector background or by differences in promoter stringency. however, we found that in the mammalian cell-based assay, transactivation activity of the r1699 variants was reduced in a fashion comparable to the negative controls.  in fact, all variants presented here with the exception of r1699w and r1699q behave similarly in the yeast and mammalian-based assay.  thus, it is possible that specific protein alterations that have an effect on in vivo phenotype remain undetected in the simplified yeast model.

(b) s1655f, t1700a, g1706e, v1713a, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, l1764p, and i1766s represent deleterious/high-risk variants; (c) variants r1443g, l1546n, l1564p, l1664p, v1804d, and p1806a do not represent high-risk variants, although we cannot rule out the possibility that they may represent moderate-risk variants; and (d) variant g1788d does not represent a neutral variant, although we cannot rule out the possibility that it may represent a moderate-risk variant instead of a deleterious one.  importantly, despite variation in levels in yeast and mammalian assays, no variant presented clearly conflicting results (>80% in one test and <40% in another). these results also highlight the difficulty in relying on limited pedigree data that may suggest cosegregation with the cancer phenotype (supplementary  s1).   we also did functional tests on 14 additional variants and functionally classified six (r1443g, v1534m, d1546n, e1644g, l1664p, and p1806a) as neutral and eight (s1655f, g1706e, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, l1764p, and i1766s) as deleterious ( 4).  the v1534m classification is supported by co-occurrence data (table 2) whereas the d1546n classification is supported by clinical data, specifically from family 230 (supplementary  s1) in which at least two affected women have been shown not to carry the variant.  structural analysis is consistent with the classification of all brct variants (s1655f, l1664p, g1706e, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, l1764p, i1766s, and p1806a; table 1).  however, caution should be exercised in the classification until further evidence for these thresholds is obtained. in an attempt to clarify the functional importance of the brca1 cterminus as a transcription activator in cancer predisposition, we have characterized the effect of c-terminal germ-line variants identified in scandinavian breast and ovarian cancer families.  missense variants a1669s, c1697r, r1699w, r1699q, a1708e, s1715r, g1738e and a truncating mutation, w1837x, were characterized using yeast- and mammalian-based transcription assays.  in addition, four additional missense variants (v1665m, d1692n, s1715n, and d1733g) and one in-frame deletion (v1688del) were included in the study. here we analyze missense variants and one truncating mutation that localize to the c-terminal region of brca1 (figure 1).  these variants were not found in 50 healthy swedish control individuals (no screen has been done for g1738e).  moreover, over 450 index cases with familial history of breast-ovarian cancer have been screened for mutations in brca1 and the variants reported here have only been found in their respective family, indicating that they represent rare variants. our result is in agreement with pedigree analysis in which the mutation segregates with the disease (figure 2, lund 190).  variants c1697r, a1708e, s1715r and g1738e displayed loss of activity suggesting that they represent disease-associated mutations (table 1), an observation in agreement with pedigree analysis for mutations c1697r, a1708e and s1715r (figure 2).  the amino acid substitution c1697r is a rather dramatic one, from a nonpolar residue capable of forming disulfide linkages to a positively charged residue, located in a critical α-helix based on the structure of xrcc1 brct (29). however, co-segregation between the mutation and breast and ovarian cancer is observed and these cancer forms are predominant among women in the pedigree (figure 2).  we recently found the g1738e variant, which displayed loss of transactivation activity in our assays, in a young patient affected with bilateral breast cancer and a family history of disease.  in addition, others found the variant in a family with a strong pattern of hereditary disease in which the patient carrying the alteration suffered from breast cancer at an early age (t.

however, given that fact that pedigree analysis, transcriptional activation, and protease sensitivity indicate a high risk variant, our conclusion is that, although the change is a conservative one, the side chain size threshold in the algorithm needs to be refined.  in summary, we have classified six missense variants (l1407p, m1628v, t1685i, a1752p, g1788v, and v1809f) as probable deleterious/high risk variants and the remainder as probable neutral/low clinical significance variants (h1402y, h1421y, s1512i, m1628t, and t1720a), with two variants (g1706a and w1837r) left unclassified. for example, variants that are moderately well folded based on proteolytic stability can often be purified and studied in more detail.  circular dicroism spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry have been used to quantitatively assess the fold stability of v1696l, r1699w, m1775k, m1775r, m1783t, v1808a, v1809f, and v1833m (49–51).  although our proteolytic assay indicated that the stability of two of these variants, r1699w and v1808a, were indistinguishable from wild-type, the more sensitive thermodynamic studies of the purified forms of these variants reveal a small but significant reduction in fold stability. in addition, quantitative assays of phosphopeptide binding, such as isothermal titration calorimetry, can reveal the detailed thermodynamics of peptide-brct interactions (50,51).  the structural rearrangements induced by three of these variants, m1775r (47), m1775k (37), and v1809f (14), have been visualized through lee  page 8 cancer res.  author manuscript; available in pmc 2011 june 15. for m1775r and m1775k, the substituted positively charged side chain adopts an orientation that fills the specificity pocket and blocks the binding of the phe side chain at the +3 position of the target peptide.  intriguingly, the v1809f substitution, which occurs far from the +3 pocket, induces a series of conformational adjustments that results in the movement of met1775 to fill the specificity pocket, explaining the loss of peptide binding specificity and transcriptional activity associated with this variant.  nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (snp) that lead to amino acid substitutions are likely to have diverse phenotypic consequences and implications for human disease.

2607 ||  three of them are exposed on the face away from the putative binding site proposed above, whereas the remaining five mutations are conservative changes in the core of the fold (table 1 ⇓ ;  2 ⇓ ).  five mutations (g1706a, s1715n, f1761i, m1775v, and a1843t) in the total set of 37, with impact on the transcriptional activation function that is known, could not be readily explained.  possible reasons for the inability to explain these mutants are discussed in detail in supplementary table 3.
2608 ||  classification of these variants into pathogenic or non-pathogenic type is an important challenge in genetic diagnosis and counseling.  the aim of the present study is to functionally assess a set of 7 missense vus (q1409l, s1473p, e1586g, r1589h, y1703s, w1718l and g1770v) located in the c-terminal region of brca1 by combining in silico prediction tools and structural analysis with a transcription activation (ta) assay.  the in silico prediction programs gave discrepant results making its interpretation difficult. structural analysis of the three variants located in the brct domains (y1703s, w1718l and g1770v) reveals significant alterations of brct structure.  the ta assay shows that variants y1703s, w1718l and g1770v dramatically compromise the transcriptional activity of brca1, while variants q1409l, s1473p, e1586g and r1589h behave like wild-type brca1.  in conclusion, our results suggest that variants y1703s, w1718l and g1770v can be classified as likely pathogenic brca1 mutations. our results indicate that three of them (y1703s, w1718l, g1770v) have significant functional impact and may represent pathogenic brca1 variants while the remaining four do not have a functional impact.   go to: materials and methods brca1 vus  seven missense brca1 c-terminal variants (q1409l, s1473p, e1586g, r1589h, y1703s, w1718l and g1770v), identified through genetic testing of patients with suspicion of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (hbocs) as part of the hereditary cancer program of the catalan institute of oncology, were included in this study (figure 1).  written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. table 1 shows the outcomes of all methods, for comparison with high discrepancy between different programs.  the two integrative algorithms indicate that variants q1409l, s1473p, e1586g and r1589h have a benign effect and that g1770v has a damaging effect, whereas they disagree in their predictions for variants y1703s and w1718l.  furthermore the results of pon-p and condel for q1409l and g1770v strikingly diverge from those of align-gvgd, which classify q1409l as most likely to interfere with brca1 function and g1770v as less likely using the alignment from human to frog. the luciferase activity of these three mutants was very similar to that observed for the known pathogenic mutants used as controls: that is <5%, compared to the wild-type construct.  conversely, the remaining four vus (q1409l, s1473p, e1586g and r1589h) displayed similar transcriptional activity to that of the wild-type construct.   figure 2 figure 2 results of functional assay of the studied missense variants. if we tried to order the variants according to their deleteriousness as predicted from each of the algorithms, they would yield as many orders as algorithms tested.  in general terms, the two integrative programs gave quite similar results, predicting a damaging effect for one of the variants (g1770v) and a benign effect for four of them (q1409l, s1473p, e1586g and r1589h), while variants y1703s and w1718l were difficult to classify.  therefore, attending to the results obtained in this study, we consider the use of in silico programs not reliable enough to get an approximation of the pathogenicity of a given vus.

confer (intermediate) breast and ovarian cancer risk ( 31, 32 ).  to allow direct comparison of results from different assays, we repeated the cisplatin sensitivity and proliferation assays in

stem cells, in contrast with r1699q, which was recently shown to confer intermediate risk of hboc ( 32 ).   our assay system yielded ambivalent results for nine other variants: s4f, s308a, s1651p, s1651f, t1691i, v1736a, e1735k, h1746q, and r1753t.  t1691i and e1735k were classifi ed as functionally impaired in only one cisplatin sensitivity test, whereas values from repeat experiments could not be taken into account because of rse values above . s4f, s1651p, s1651f, v1736a, h1746q, and r1753t were differently classifi ed in repeat experiments, which may refl ect technical fl aws or intermediate activity of these variants.  of note, the v1736a mutation was recently identifi ed as a pathogenic variant with hypomorphic activity in dna repair ( 31 ).  although we did not measure signifi cant hr activity of v1736a in a dr-gfp gene conversion assay, intermediate activity of this variant is supported by the results of the proliferation assays and additional cisplatin sensitivity assays. although the differences in sensitivity of brca1-defi cient versus brca1-profi cient embryonic stem cells are larger for olaparib than for cisplatin, increased variation between repeat experiments allowed us to identify functional defects only for l1407 and not for the other two variants in the palb2 interaction domain, m1400v and m1411t.  however, the r1699q and v1736a variants, which are known to have hypomorphic activity, clearly showed a defect in the response to olaparib.  interestingly, both mutations are in the brct domain, and it has recently been shown that mutation of this domain especially confers sensitivity to parp inhibition ( 41 ). g1706e, one of the cancer-associated (iarc class 5) variants, is defective in the proteolysis and peptidebinding assays; however, it shows an intermediate level of transcriptional activity.  the neutral (iarc class 1) variant v1736a exhibited the least agreement between the different assays, showing significant sensitivity to proteolysis and a strong transcriptional defect while showing intermediate/strong levels of phosphopeptide interaction.  considering the overall high specificity and sensitivity obtained in the assays (supplementary table s2), we have defined limits to predict disease association for the uncharacterized variants based on the biochemical and transcriptional assay data (table 1;  2). although still far from clinical application, these methods have provided important information.   here we apply a transcription-based assay to assess the effect of 22 variants (r1443g, v1534m, d1546n, l1564p, p1614s, e1644g, s1655f, l1664p, t1700a, g1706e, v1713a, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, i1766s, l1764p, q1785h, g1788d, e1794d, v1804d, and p1806a) on the activity of the brca1 cooh terminus (amino acids 1,396–1,863) and interpret the findings in light of all available clinical, genetic, and structural information.  these ucvs were found in individuals from families with breast or ovarian cancer in which no other deleterious mutation in brca1 or brca2 was found, and thus it is not clear whether they are causally related to disease.  go to: materials and methods constructs  control constructs containing the wild-type (wt) brca1, s1613g, m1775r, and y1853x were previously described (12).  mutations r1443g, v1534m, d1546n, l1564p, p1614s, e1644g, s1655f, l1664p, t1700a, g1706e, v1713a, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, i1766s, l1764p, q1785h, g1788d, e1794d, v1804d, and p1806a were introduced by splicing by overlapping extension pcr (20) using plasmid p385-brca1 as template.  primers sequences are available on request. cells were cotransformed with a lexa-responsive β-galactosidase reporter gene (diagram shown above the graph) and a lexa dbd fusion to residues .  sixteen ucvs in the brctdomains (s1655f, l1664p, t1700a, g1706e, v1713a, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, l1764p, i1766s, g1788d, q1785h, e1794d, v1804d, and p1806a) were also tested.  variants s1655f, t1700a, g1706e, v1713a, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, l1764p, and 1766s displayed markedly decreased activity with <40% of the wt activity in yeast and <20% in mammalian cells ( 2a and b).  as a first approach, we arbitrarily considered >80% and <40% of wt activity as the thresholds to classify the variants as neutral or deleterious, respectively (12).  using this threshold, our data indicate that (a) v1534m, p1614s, e1644g, q1785h, and e1794d do not represent high-risk variants and are likely to be neutral; (b) s1655f, t1700a, g1706e, v1713a, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, l1764p, and i1766s represent deleterious/high-risk variants; (c) variants r1443g, l1546n, l1564p, l1664p, v1804d, and p1806a do not represent high-risk variants, although we cannot rule out the possibility that they may represent moderate-risk variants; and (d) variant g1788d does not represent a neutral variant, although we cannot rule out the possibility that it may represent a moderate-risk variant instead of a deleterious one.  importantly, despite variation in levels in yeast and mammalian assays, no variant presented clearly conflicting results (>80% in one test and <40% in another). excluding the possibility of nonpaternity, this suggests that the variant is neutral because no cancer was reported in the deceased father and his family.   v1736a three specimens from two independent tumors from the proband of aus, who had bilateral breast cancer, tested positive for the variant.  two specimens from the left breast tumor showed loh of the mutant allele and one specimen from the right breast tumor showed no loh. these results also highlight the difficulty in relying on limited pedigree data that may suggest cosegregation with the cancer phenotype (supplementary  s1).   we also did functional tests on 14 additional variants and functionally classified six (r1443g, v1534m, d1546n, e1644g, l1664p, and p1806a) as neutral and eight (s1655f, g1706e, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, l1764p, and i1766s) as deleterious ( 4).  the v1534m classification is supported by co-occurrence data (table 2) whereas the d1546n classification is supported by clinical data, specifically from family 230 (supplementary  s1) in which at least two affected women have been shown not to carry the variant.  structural analysis is consistent with the classification of all brct variants (s1655f, l1664p, g1706e, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, l1764p, i1766s, and p1806a; table 1).  however, caution should be exercised in the classification until further evidence for these thresholds is obtained.

dynamic range between brca2- defi cient cells and isogenic brca2-profi cient controls than for cisplatin ( 30 ). we therefore tested complementation of parp inhibitor sensitivity for a number of brca1 mutants and the brca1 wild-type control.  given the unexpected neutral effects of the m1400v, l1407p, and m1411t mutations in the palb2 interaction domain, we decided to include these variants in this series, as well as the r1699q and v1736a variants that have recently been shown to confer (intermediate) breast and ovarian cancer risk ( 31, 32 ).  to allow direct comparison of results from different assays, we repeated the cisplatin sensitivity and proliferation assays in parallel to the olaparib sensitivity assay. however, this increase in dynamic range is accompanied by an increased variation between repeat experiments for brca1-profi cient samples.  nevertheless, the functional defect of the r1699q and v1736a mutations becomes more evident, and there also downloaded from

the difference with brca1 wild-type is not signifi cant. the pathogenic 5382insc truncation mutation could not be classifi ed because it scored as neutral in one of three transfection series.  this was probably due to technical reasons, as the 5382insc mutation did not restore hr activity in brca1 -defi cient embryonic stem cells, in contrast with r1699q, which was recently shown to confer intermediate risk of hboc ( 32 ).   our assay system yielded ambivalent results for nine other variants: s4f, s308a, s1651p, s1651f, t1691i, v1736a, e1735k, h1746q, and r1753t. although the differences in sensitivity of brca1-defi cient versus brca1-profi cient embryonic stem cells are larger for olaparib than for cisplatin, increased variation between repeat experiments allowed us to identify functional defects only for l1407 and not for the other two variants in the palb2 interaction domain, m1400v and m1411t.  however, the r1699q and v1736a variants, which are known to have hypomorphic activity, clearly showed a defect in the response to olaparib.  interestingly, both mutations are in the brct domain, and it has recently been shown that mutation of this domain especially confers sensitivity to parp inhibition ( 41 ). in an attempt to clarify the functional importance of the brca1 cterminus as a transcription activator in cancer predisposition, we have characterized the effect of c-terminal germ-line variants identified in scandinavian breast and ovarian cancer families.  missense variants a1669s, c1697r, r1699w, r1699q, a1708e, s1715r, g1738e and a truncating mutation, w1837x, were characterized using yeast- and mammalian-based transcription assays.  in addition, four additional missense variants (v1665m, d1692n, s1715n, and d1733g) and one in-frame deletion (v1688del) were included in the study. results were comparable in both yeast strains in a semi-quantitative assay (table 1).  analysis of variants identified in lund families variants a1669s, r1699w and r1699q, displayed wild-type activity suggesting that they represent benign polymorphisms (table 1).  for variant a1669s, the data from functional assays are in agreement with the pedigree analysis (figure 2). disease association is further emphasized by other findings where r1699w was found in a large pedigree in which several women, through three generations and across four degrees of relatedness, diagnosed with ovarian cancer carried the variant (frank ts and scalia j, manuscript in preparation).  disease association is less clear for r1699q, found in a patient diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 39 but without familial history of disease.  others found this variant in an unaffected individual, whose mother was diagnosed with premenopausal breast cancer and considered to be an obligate carrier of the r1699q variant, and whose grandmother was diagnosed with ovarian cancer at the approximate age of 60 years but without known vallon-christersson  page 3 hum

transcription activation was comparable between yeast and mammalian cells (figure 3a,b).  in 293t cells, variants r1699w and r1699q displayed loss of function phenotype in accordance with pedigree analysis, suggesting that these variants are indeed cancer-associated vallon-christersson  page 5 hum mol genet. however, we found that in the mammalian cell-based assay, transactivation activity of the r1699 variants was reduced in a fashion comparable to the negative controls.  in fact, all variants presented here with the exception of r1699w and r1699q behave similarly in the yeast and

2627 ||  results sift and polyphen prediction programs identify probably deleterious nonsynonymous missense variants the mutational analysis of 276 hereditary breast and ovarian cancer families, performed by automatic direct sequencing of all coding regions and intron–exon boundaries, has revealed several novel as well as previously described variants of brca1 gene.  by using two prediction software programs, sift and polyphen, seven nonsynonymous variants likely disrupting the gene function, n132 k, y179c, n550 h, s1164i, s1512i, i1766s, a1789 t, were identified.  among those, two variants, the 3610g4t (3491g4t, s1164i) and the 5484g4a (5365g4a, a1789 t), were studied for the first time in this analysis;

the neutral p1010s; and the y179 the expression of these proteins assessed by western blot indicated different levels of expression ( 2a, lanes 4–8), suggesting that the stability of the proteins may be affected by the mutations.  however, in another yeast strain this difference has not been seen, indicating that the different protein level might be dependent on the genetic background of the strain used [bennett , 2008]. the missense variants c61g, n132 k, y179c, f486l, n550 h, p1010s, s1164i, and s1512i did not complement the growth suppression phenotype, in fact the average number of cells per colony ranged from 4,000 to 22,000 ( 2c), but they could not be classified as neutral because they map outside the brct domains.  the three brct mutants a1708e, i1766s, and a1789 t fully inhibited the growth suppression, as the number of cells per colony ranged from 402,000 to 457,500.  the expression of the m1775r variants that gave colonies containing about 180,500 cells per colony only partially complemented the scp, as reported by others ( 2c) [coyne , 2004; humphrey , 1997].a.  pi222 i1766s ovary 52 n. a. however, the other known deleterious variant m1775r significantly increased both recombination events ( 4a and b) [mirkovic , 2004; phelan , 2005].  moreover, the expression of the i1766s variant showed a significant increase of intra- and interchromosomal recombination ( 4a and b).  we also constructed two new brca1 mutants that expressed two deleted proteins: the r1443x and the e143x. a: western blot analysis of yeast cells expressing brca1wt and five missense variants; 30 &mgrg of total proteins were loaded on each lane: lane 1, extract from rs112 expressing brca1wt (galactose); lane 2 and 3, extracts from noninduced rs112 (glucose) and rs112 carrying the empty vector.  in lane 4 to 8, extracts from rs112 expressing the variants were loaded as follows: a1789 t, i1766s, a1708e, p1010s, and y179 in lanes 9 and 10, extracts from yeast expressing the truncated r1443x protein and brca1wt were loaded; in lane 11, extracts from yeast expressing the truncated e143x were loaded.  the level of the 3-pgk was determined as loading control. the expression of brct missense variants also inhibited the growth suppression in the rs112 yeast strain, confirming that the scp assay could help to classify some brca1 missense variants as deleterious.  western blot analysis showed that the level of the a1708e and i1766s, which suppressed the growth inhibition phenotype, was higher than in the wild-type and the other variants.  on the other hand, the level of the variant a1789 t is lower than the level of the other two brct variants, indicating that the growth suppression phenotype is not due to changes in the expression and/or stability of the brca1 variants. cerevisiae could be a useful genetic tool to classify brca1 missense variants as deleterious.  particularly, our results indicated that the variants n132 k, y179c, s1164i, and i1766s should be assessed as potentially deleterious, and the n550 h and s1512i variant as neutral.  the a1789 t variant might also be deleterious, although it did not affect hr as it showed a clear effect on cell growth inhibition and clinical data showed cosegregation with disease in the family and wild-type allele inactivation in the tumor sample. structural studies reveal that both arg1699 and met1775 make critical direct contacts to the phosphopeptide (12–14), and structural investigations of the m1775r and m1775k variants reveal subtle structural rearrangements that block the +3 specificity pocket (37,47).  two of the cancer-associated (iarc class 5) variants, i1766s and g1788v, were highly defective in the proteolysis and transcriptional assays; however, they showed significant levels of nonspecific peptide binding, independent of phosphorylation.  it is likely that the unfolded state of these variants exposes hydrophobic residues that are responsible for these nonspecific interactions, as suggested previously (14). although still far from clinical application, these methods have provided important information.   here we apply a transcription-based assay to assess the effect of 22 variants (r1443g, v1534m, d1546n, l1564p, p1614s, e1644g, s1655f, l1664p, t1700a, g1706e, v1713a, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, i1766s, l1764p, q1785h, g1788d, e1794d, v1804d, and p1806a) on the activity of the brca1 cooh terminus (amino acids 1,396–1,863) and interpret the findings in light of all available clinical, genetic, and structural information.  these ucvs were found in individuals from families with breast or ovarian cancer in which no other deleterious mutation in brca1 or brca2 was found, and thus it is not clear whether they are causally related to disease.  go to: materials and methods constructs  control constructs containing the wild-type (wt) brca1, s1613g, m1775r, and y1853x were previously described (12).  mutations r1443g, v1534m, d1546n, l1564p, p1614s, e1644g, s1655f, l1664p, t1700a, g1706e, v1713a, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, i1766s, l1764p, q1785h, g1788d, e1794d, v1804d, and p1806a were introduced by splicing by overlapping extension pcr (20) using plasmid p385-brca1 as template.  primers sequences are available on request. cells were cotransformed with a lexa-responsive β-galactosidase reporter gene (diagram shown above the graph) and a lexa dbd fusion to residues .  sixteen ucvs in the brctdomains (s1655f, l1664p, t1700a, g1706e, v1713a, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, l1764p, i1766s, g1788d, q1785h, e1794d, v1804d, and p1806a) were also tested.  variants s1655f, t1700a, g1706e, v1713a, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, l1764p, and 1766s displayed markedly decreased activity with <40% of the wt activity in yeast and <20% in mammalian cells ( 2a and b).  as a first approach, we arbitrarily considered >80% and <40% of wt activity as the thresholds to classify the variants as neutral or deleterious, respectively (12).  using this threshold, our data indicate that (a) v1534m, p1614s, e1644g, q1785h, and e1794d do not represent high-risk variants and are likely to be neutral; (b) s1655f, t1700a, g1706e, v1713a, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, l1764p, and i1766s represent deleterious/high-risk variants; (c) variants r1443g, l1546n, l1564p, l1664p, v1804d, and p1806a do not represent high-risk variants, although we cannot rule out the possibility that they may represent moderate-risk variants; and (d) variant g1788d does not represent a neutral variant, although we cannot rule out the possibility that it may represent a moderate-risk variant instead of a deleterious one.  importantly, despite variation in levels in yeast and mammalian assays, no variant presented clearly conflicting results (>80% in one test and <40% in another). these results also highlight the difficulty in relying on limited pedigree data that may suggest cosegregation with the cancer phenotype (supplementary  s1).   we also did functional tests on 14 additional variants and functionally classified six (r1443g, v1534m, d1546n, e1644g, l1664p, and p1806a) as neutral and eight (s1655f, g1706e, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, l1764p, and i1766s) as deleterious ( 4).  the v1534m classification is supported by co-occurrence data (table 2) whereas the d1546n classification is supported by clinical data, specifically from family 230 (supplementary  s1) in which at least two affected women have been shown not to carry the variant.  structural analysis is consistent with the classification of all brct variants (s1655f, l1664p, g1706e, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, l1764p, i1766s, and p1806a; table 1).  however, caution should be exercised in the classification until further evidence for these thresholds is obtained.

table 1). g1706a showed a slightly reduced activity in yeast but a markedly reduced activity in mammalian cells.  variant t1720a had a slightly reduced activity in yeast and but activity comparable to wild type brca1 in mammalian cells.  based on the results obtained we would tentatively classify t1720a as a neutral/low clinical significance variant. of the seven variants for which the method based on interspecific variation was able to reach a conclusion, the data confirmed the classification based on our functional tests in six cases (l1407p, h1402y, t1685i, g1706a, g1788v, and w1837r) but presented a contradiction for variant m1628v.  the pedigree analysis confirmed our results for brca bilat 42 m brca 29 m brca 35 m brca 55 m prophylactic mastectomy lund 897 m = v1809f 1 brca 41 brca 66 brca 55 brca 44 wt m wt wt m brca 54 brca 51 cl-8 m = t1720a 3 brca 81 brca 85 wt f92 m = t1720a brca 55 brca 44 m brca 40 m wt brca 48 brca 49 ov 54 t334 m = m1628t brca 52 brca? 52 m wt wt m wt m m m m wt wt wt m 6-99-006 m = g1706a 2 brca65 br 44-54 brca 87 ov 45 brca 53 m792 m = w1837r othca 70 (colon?) prostate leukaemia? 78 m brca 40? sto cns? 42 brca 39 homcs 57 ovarian disgerminoma 27 m ovcs 58 bladder 53 wt brca 52 wt brca > 70? figure 3 pedigrees of missense variants in brca1.  the presence (m) or absence (wt) of the variants in the germ line of tested individuals is indicated.6 11 19 found in a early onset breast tumour, the mutant allele (present in the germline) was absent in control population and was retained in the tumour. 40 clinical data favour classification as deleterious mutation;

however, given that fact that pedigree analysis, transcriptional activation, and protease sensitivity indicate a high risk variant, our conclusion is that, although the change is a conservative one, the side chain size threshold in the algorithm needs to be refined.  in summary, we have classified six missense variants (l1407p, m1628v, t1685i, a1752p, g1788v, and v1809f) as probable deleterious/high risk variants and the remainder as probable neutral/low clinical significance variants (h1402y, h1421y, s1512i, m1628t, and t1720a), with two variants (g1706a and w1837r) left unclassified.  previously, all the known deleterious missense changes were in the ring domain or brct repeats.
2632 ||  the m18t and t37r variants did not complement the hdr assay.  variants that could complement the hdr activity were i21v, i31m, i42v, l52, d67y, and r71g.   we tested whether the mutant brca1 proteins used in this study could bind to bard1 (figure 5). purified proteins were analyzed by immunoblots specific for the ha-epitope to evaluate the effectiveness of expression and purification of the mutant brca1 protein and specific for the endogenous bard1 protein.  we found that brca1 variant proteins i21v, i31m, i42v, l52f, d67y, and r71g effectively purified cellular bard1 protein.  these are the same proteins that functioned in homologous recombination. with regard to those variants with inferred breast cancer association, the centrosome duplication assay had an intermediate result for the brca1–d67y variant, which is nonpathogeni the t37r variant was defective for both dna repair assays, but was functional in control of the centrosome duplication.  five amino acid residues away, the i42v variant had the opposite pattern as t37r, with defective centrosome control but fully functional in both dna repair assays.  experimentally, the centrosome regulation assay is much more difficult to perform than the hdr assay, making it not as desirable an assay for analysis of brca1 variants.  we find that there are some discordancies between functional assays of the variants.  the most striking are at t37r and i42v.  brca1–t37r was defective for both dna repair processes, but was fully functional for control of centrosomes.  conversely, brca1–i42v was defective for control of centrosome duplication [kais , 2012] but functional in the dna repair processes.  from this result, we hypothesize that the protein–brca1 contacts in the dna repair pathways depend on the t37 residue, whereas a different protein–brca1 contact is important for regulating the centrosome duplication.
2633 ||  it is possible that the e2 interaction is stabilized by the presence of bard1 in the biochemical assay.  the brca1:e2 interaction requires integrity of the brca1 n-terminus the bard1 interaction was less sensitive to missense substitution of brca1 than the e2 interaction and restricted to the flanking helices that form the brca1:bard1 interaction face (q12y, l82p) and the zn2þ-ligating residues of the ring (c39s/l, h41r, c44r, c47r and c61l) ( 3h).  however, the impact of these variants was measurable only at high concentrations of 3at, or in a high threshold assay, suggesting that these mutations weaken the high-affinity bard1:brca1 interaction.
2634 ||  classification of these variants into pathogenic or non-pathogenic type is an important challenge in genetic diagnosis and counseling.  the aim of the present study is to functionally assess a set of 7 missense vus (q1409l, s1473p, e1586g, r1589h, y1703s, w1718l and g1770v) located in the c-terminal region of brca1 by combining in silico prediction tools and structural analysis with a transcription activation (ta) assay.  the in silico prediction programs gave discrepant results making its interpretation difficult. structural analysis of the three variants located in the brct domains (y1703s, w1718l and g1770v) reveals significant alterations of brct structure.  the ta assay shows that variants y1703s, w1718l and g1770v dramatically compromise the transcriptional activity of brca1, while variants q1409l, s1473p, e1586g and r1589h behave like wild-type brca1.  in conclusion, our results suggest that variants y1703s, w1718l and g1770v can be classified as likely pathogenic brca1 mutations. in the work presented here, we combine a functional assay - the transcription activation (ta) assay, which is based on the function of the brca1 carboxy-terminal region (aa 1396–1863) in transcriptional activation domain when linked to a sequence-specific dna binding module - [10] with protein structural analyses [11] to assess the functional impact of seven brca1 c-terminal vus.  our results indicate that three of them (y1703s, w1718l, g1770v) have significant functional impact and may represent pathogenic brca1 variants while the remaining four do not have a functional impact.   go to: materials and methods brca1 vus  seven missense brca1 c-terminal variants (q1409l, s1473p, e1586g, r1589h, y1703s, w1718l and g1770v), identified through genetic testing of patients with suspicion of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (hbocs) as part of the hereditary cancer program of the catalan institute of oncology, were included in this study (figure 1). the structures were collected by blast-querying the pdb using the brca1 sequence (uniprot accession code p38398).  only the vus mapped in the brct tandem domains (y1703s, w1718l and g1770v) were analyzed using this approach, as there are no structural data for the upstream domain or regions.   go to: results in silico predictions  several algorithms designed to predict deleterious versus neutral missense changes were used (table 1). table 1 shows the outcomes of all methods, for comparison with high discrepancy between different programs.  the two integrative algorithms indicate that variants q1409l, s1473p, e1586g and r1589h have a benign effect and that g1770v has a damaging effect, whereas they disagree in their predictions for variants y1703s and w1718l.  furthermore the results of pon-p and condel for q1409l and g1770v strikingly diverge from those of align-gvgd, which classify q1409l as most likely to interfere with brca1 function and g1770v as less likely using the alignment from human to frog.  table 1 table 1 in silico predictions for pathogenicity of the variants presented in this study.  transcription activation assay  using the transcriptional assay, three vus (y1703s, w1718l and g1770v) showed a significant decrease in reporter expression compared to wild-type brca1 (figure 2).  the luciferase activity of these three mutants was very similar to that observed for the known pathogenic mutants used as controls: that is <5%, compared to the wild-type construct.  figure 2 figure 2 results of functional assay of the studied missense variants.  protein structural rationalizations  a structural analysis was performed for those vus located in the brct domains (y1703s, w1718l and g1770v).  y1703 is located at the brct dual-repeat-interaction interface (figure 3a), directed towards the linker. the variants selected were vus identified in a clinical scenario, which are located between amino acid residues 1,396 and 1,863 of the full-length brca1 sequence and include part of a coiled-coil domain (aa 1,364–1,437) and the brct tandem domains (aa 1,646–1,863) (figure 1).  notably, six of the vus (q1409l, s1473p, e1586g, y1703s, w1718l and g1770v) had not been recorded in the locus-specific database for mutations in brca1 and brca2, bic (breast cancer information core database, http://research. nhgri.  the use of different in silico prediction algorithms gave contradictory results for some of the variants (table 1) making it difficult to draw any clear conclusion.  for example, there is a striking difference between the results for three versions of polyphen-2 as run from different sources; w1718l can yield probabilities of pathogenicity of ,  and , while the probabilities for q1409l, s1473p and e1586g range from values below  to values above  in the different versions.  if we tried to order the variants according to their deleteriousness as predicted from each of the algorithms, they would yield as many orders as algorithms tested.  in general terms, the two integrative programs gave quite similar results, predicting a damaging effect for one of the variants (g1770v) and a benign effect for four of them (q1409l, s1473p, e1586g and r1589h), while variants y1703s and w1718l were difficult to classify.  therefore, attending to the results obtained in this study, we consider the use of in silico programs not reliable enough to get an approximation of the pathogenicity of a given vus. in this study two constructs containing previously classified pathogenic variants (iarc class 5), m1775r and y1853x, were used as negative controls and a construct with the wild-type brca1 c-terminal region was used as a positive control.  this assay clearly identified a functional defect for three of the variants (y1703s, w1718l and g1770v), whereas the remaining variants gave results very similar to those of the wild-type controls.  it should be noted that residue w1718 appears to be highly prone to mutation, and although the mutation studied here has never been reported, mutations w1718s and w1718c have been described in hbocs families; in addition, a panel of assays including protease sensitivity, phosphopeptide binding activity and specificity, as well as the ta assay, revealed that both of these variants have strong functional effects [28].  in summary, in a clinical context, extensive worldwide analysis of brca1 has identified a large number of vus, most of them unique, which need to be classified for the purposes of diagnosis and genetic counseling.  by combining functional analysis and structural rationalizations, this study shows that three brca1 vus (y1703s, w1718l and g1770v) have profound functional impact and may be pathogenic variants.  by contrast, the other four variants did not alter the function of brca1 in the ta assay and should remain classified as vus.
2637 ||  it was shown that the transcriptional activation assay could be used as a test to characterise mutations in the carboxy-terminus region of brca1 encompassing residues 1396–1863.  thirteen missense variants (h1402y, l1407p, h1421y, s1512i, m1628t, m1628v, t1685i, g1706a, t1720a, a1752p, g1788v, v1809f, and w1837r) were specifically investigated.  conclusions: while individual classification schemes for brca1 alleles still present limitations, a combination of several methods provides a more powerful way of identifying variants that are causally linked to a high risk of breast and ovarian cancer. along those lines, we hypothesised that unclassified missense variants located in regions of brca1 that contribute to transcription activation besides the brct domains might be amenable to a transcription based classification.  in the present study we show that the transcriptional activation assay can be used as a test to characterise mutations in the region encompassing aa 1396–1863 (exons 13 to 24) and we specifically investigated 13 missense variants (h1402y, l1407p, h1421y, s1512i, m1628t, m1628v, t1685i, g1706a, t1720a, a1752p, g1788v, v1809f, and w1837r).  in addition, we analysed all the mutations using a prediction algorithm based on interspecific sequence variation and grantham matrices.5 6 mutation h1402y was introduced by direct pcr using primers 24endt and h1402y-u (59 ggaattccagaggg ataccatgcaatataacc 39).  mutations l1407p, a1752p, and g1706a were introduced by the quickchange (stratagene) method according to the manufacturer’s instruction.  the following primers containing the alteration of interest were used for pcr involving the wild type constructs produced in a methylation competent bacterial strain, and amplification was carried out using pfu polymerase.  l1407p (l1407p-u, 59 ctgatcaagccccagca gg 39; l1407p-l, 59 cctgctggggcttgatcag 39); g1706a (g1706af, 59 gacactgaaatattttctagcaattgccggcg gaaaatgg 39; g1706ar’, 59 ccattttccgccggcaattg ctagaaaatatttcagtgtc 39); a1752p (a1752pf, 59 ccaa ggtccaaagcgacctcgagaatcccaggac 39; a752pr, 59 gtcctgggattctcgaggtcgctttggaccttgg 39).  dpn1 was subsequently added to digest the parental plasmid leaving only cdnas with the introduced mutations to be transformed into bacteria. these results suggest a high sensitivity and specificity for this assay.  results frequency in control populations six variants (g1706a, a1708e, a1752p, m1775r, g1788v, and w1837r) were assessed using pcr/ldr followed by assessment in a dna microarray30 in 500 healthy women without cancer of varying ages (18–40 years) and ethnic groups.  all were at a frequency of 0/500. results show that both in yeast and mammalian cells the three negative controls located in the brct domain lose most of transcription activation function consistent with a loss of function mutation, whereas the positive control s1613g had an activity equal to or higher than the wild type, as observed previously5 6 (fig 2b and 2c).  seven unclassified missense variants in the brct domains (t1685i, g1706a, t1720a, a1752p, g1788v, v1809f, and w1837r) were then tested.  variants t1685i, a1752p, g1788v, v1809f, and w1837r showed greatly decreased transcription activation 140 phelan, ðapic´, tice, et al www. once it was verified that the extended assay assigned positive and negative controls correctly, seven missense variants in the brct domain and six variants outside the brct domain were tested (fig 2).  the variants were chosen because they were identified as the sole brca1 alteration in individuals considered to be at high risk for breast or ovarian cancer (s1512i, m1628v, m1628t, t1685i, g1706a, t1720a, a1752p, g1788v, v1809f, and w1837r) or were located at or in close proximity to the putative coiled-coil domain (h1402y, l1407p, and h1421y).  seven of the variants caused a dramatic loss of the transcription activation function (l1407p, m1628v, t1685i, a1752p, g1788v, v1809f, and w1837r), similar to known high risk mutation controls, suggesting that they may constitute deleterious/high risk variants (fig 2b and 2c; table 1).6 11 19 found in a early onset breast tumour, the mutant allele (present in the germline) was absent in control population and was retained in the tumour. 40 clinical data favour classification as deleterious mutation; was used as negative control in transcription assays 19 t1720a a5277g tivs n ?

2639 ||  the correlation between level of cross-species sequence conservation and effect of mutation on the scp is striking.  mutations altering eight of the nine residues conserved in all eight species (table 1) result in abrogation of the sc v1653m is the one exception.  conversely, mutations altering only two (1652 and 1783) of the nine positions at which multiple residues are “allowed” result in such abrogation. seven mutations at five positions display an scp similar to wild type brca1.  all but one (v1653m) alter residues incompletely conserved between the orthologs of eight vertebrate species and, in fact, three result in substitution of a residue allowed in another species at the corresponding position (t1720i, v1804a, p1806a).  with one exception (v1804d49), the scp assay predictions for these alleles are consistent with all other available predictions. this confirmation of the potential value of the scp assay highlights the need to understand its biochemical basis.  this understanding table 1 mutations characterized in this study secondary structure, predicted structural references for functional mutation allowed residues* detected in humans consequences predictions upstream of brct l1600e l n unknown k1601e k n “ lk1600/01ee lk n “ k1606e q, k, r y “ a1608v a, e y “ s1613c s, n y “ 40 a1615d a n “ m1628v m, s, v, r y “ m1628t m, s, v, r y “ p1637l p y “ 42 a164it a, s y “ brct region m1652t m, i, f y adjacent to β sheet 1, brct-n 32, 40#, 50 m1652k m, i, f n “ 32, 38, 40#, 49, 50 v1653m v y “ 49, 50 s1655f s y “ 50 t1720a t, v, i y α helix 3, brct-n 38#, 49, 50 t1720i t, v, i n “ 38#, 49, 50 v1736a v y between brct domains 38#, 49 d1739e d y “ 49 d1739g d y “ 49, 50 m1775r m y α helix 1, brct-c/ 31-34, 36, 37, 40, 49, 51 surface, disrupts interface m1783t m, i y α helix 1, brct-c/ 34, 49-51 intrahelical, destabilizes fold g1788v g y loop between α helix 1 32, 34, 44#, 49-51 and β sheet 2, brct-c, incorrect folding v1804a v, t, a, s n loop between β 51 sheets 2 and 3, brct-c v1804d v, t, a, s y “ 49-51 p1806a p, l, a, s y “ 38, 49, 50 v1808a v y β sheet 3, brct-c, 34, 49-51 destabilizes fold v1810g v y “ 49, 50 n1819y n, s, a, t, r n α helix 2, brct-c 49, 51 v1833m v y β sheet 4, brct-c, 34, 38#, 49-51 destabilizes fold y1853x y y 11 residue truncation those italicized and underlined abrogate the small colony phenotype, and thus are predicted to negatively affect brca1 structure and/or function.  *upstream of brct: allowed residues in mammals; within brct region: allowed residues in mammals, chicken and xenopus.
2641 ||  although still far from clinical application, these methods have provided important information.   here we apply a transcription-based assay to assess the effect of 22 variants (r1443g, v1534m, d1546n, l1564p, p1614s, e1644g, s1655f, l1664p, t1700a, g1706e, v1713a, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, i1766s, l1764p, q1785h, g1788d, e1794d, v1804d, and p1806a) on the activity of the brca1 cooh terminus (amino acids 1,396–1,863) and interpret the findings in light of all available clinical, genetic, and structural information.  these ucvs were found in individuals from families with breast or ovarian cancer in which no other deleterious mutation in brca1 or brca2 was found, and thus it is not clear whether they are causally related to disease.  go to: materials and methods constructs  control constructs containing the wild-type (wt) brca1, s1613g, m1775r, and y1853x were previously described (12).  mutations r1443g, v1534m, d1546n, l1564p, p1614s, e1644g, s1655f, l1664p, t1700a, g1706e, v1713a, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, i1766s, l1764p, q1785h, g1788d, e1794d, v1804d, and p1806a were introduced by splicing by overlapping extension pcr (20) using plasmid p385-brca1 as template.  primers sequences are available on request. gray boxes, brct domains; dbd, gal4 dna binding domain.  six variants (r1443g, v1534m, d1546n, l1564p, p1614s, and e1644g) that lie upstream of the brctdomains were investigated for their effect on transcription ( 2).  this region displays relatively low conservation across other brca1 orthologues with no recognizable structural motif and was therefore expected to be more tolerant to changes (32). variants r1443g, p1614s, and e1644g showed transcription activation levels equal or higher than wt brca1 whereas v1534m, d1546n, and l1564p had lower activity (between 60% and 80% of the wt activity) in yeast ( 2a).  in mammalian cells, variants v1534m, d1546n, p1614s, and e1644g showed transcription activation activity comparable to wt (within  sd) whereas variants r1443g and l1564p had reduced activity (∼55% of wt;  2b).   figure 2 figure 2 functional analysis of missense variants in brca1.  as a first approach, we arbitrarily considered >80% and <40% of wt activity as the thresholds to classify the variants as neutral or deleterious, respectively (12).  using this threshold, our data indicate that (a) v1534m, p1614s, e1644g, q1785h, and e1794d do not represent high-risk variants and are likely to be neutral; (b) s1655f, t1700a, g1706e, v1713a, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, l1764p, and i1766s represent deleterious/high-risk variants; (c) variants r1443g, l1546n, l1564p, l1664p, v1804d, and p1806a do not represent high-risk variants, although we cannot rule out the possibility that they may represent moderate-risk variants; and (d) variant g1788d does not represent a neutral variant, although we cannot rule out the possibility that it may represent a moderate-risk variant instead of a deleterious one.  importantly, despite variation in levels in yeast and mammalian assays, no variant presented clearly conflicting results (>80% in one test and <40% in another). these results also highlight the difficulty in relying on limited pedigree data that may suggest cosegregation with the cancer phenotype (supplementary  s1).   we also did functional tests on 14 additional variants and functionally classified six (r1443g, v1534m, d1546n, e1644g, l1664p, and p1806a) as neutral and eight (s1655f, g1706e, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, l1764p, and i1766s) as deleterious ( 4).  the v1534m classification is supported by co-occurrence data (table 2) whereas the d1546n classification is supported by clinical data, specifically from family 230 (supplementary  s1) in which at least two affected women have been shown not to carry the variant.

2643 ||  this outcome leads to problems in risk assessment, counseling and preventive care.  the purpose of the present study was to functionally evaluate seven unclassified variants of brca1 including a genomic deletion that leads to the in-frame loss of exons 16/17 (δ exons 16/17) in the mrna, an insertion that leads to a frameshift and an extended carboxy-terminus (5673insc), and five missense variants (k1487r, s1613c, m1652i, q1826h and v1833m).  we analyzed the variants using a functional assay based on the transcription activation property of brca1 combined with supervised learning computational models.  functional analysis indicated that variants s1613c, q1826h, and m1652i are likely to be neutral, whereas variants v1833m, δ exons 16/17, and 5673insc are likely to represent deleterious variants.  in agreement with the functional analysis, the results of the computational analysis also indicated that the latter three variants are likely to be deleterious.  here, we examine functionally seven unclassified variants of brca1, three of which have not been reported previously.  those include a deletion of exons 16 and 17 (δ exons 16/17), an insertion mutation (5673insc) leading to a frameshift that produces a protein which is 15 amino acids longer than the wild type, and missense variant q1826h.  four missense variants (k1487r, s1613c, m1652i and v1833m) previously reported in the bic database were also functionally evaluated.  we provide a bioinformatics-based prediction of their impact, and for the variants that affect the brca1 cooh-terminal (brct) domains (δ exons 16/17, 5673insc, m1652i, q1826h and v1833m) we also provide a rationalization of their impact, based on structural modeling.   go to: 2. constructs  constructs coding for exons 13–24 (amino acids 1396–1863) of wild-type (wt) brca1, positive (s1613g; neutral), and negative (m1775r and y1853x; deleterious) controls were previously described [14–16].  mutations were generated by splicing by overlapping extension pcr [20] using p385-brca1 [14] (for δ exons 16/17, k1487r, s1613c, q1826h, m1652i, and v1833m) or f3-brca1 [1] (for 5673insc) as template.  pcr products were cloned into plex9 or pgbt9 vectors. two of them (k1487r, s1613c) were chosen in order to increase coverage of the unstructured region of brca1 cooh-terminus and test the hypothesis that variants outside conserved domains are likely to be neutral.  the remaining three (m1652i, q1826h and v1833m) are missense variants in the brct domain and were chosen because they have been previously analyzed for binding to phosphopeptides (m1652i and v1833m)[31, 33], or exposed at the surface of the domain (q1826h) which represents a class of poorly studied variants [18].    1  1 diagram of constructs containing brca1 variants analyzed in this study .3.  q1826h this variant was identified in family m1123 ( 2a).  this variant results from nucleotide change 5597g→t in brca1. functional and computational analysis  . 1 bioinformatics analysis we applied our previously published bioinformatics method ls-snp [18, 25–27] to predict whether the brct missense variants m1652i, q1826h, and v1833m have a deleterious or neutral effect on brca1.  the method uses supervised learning algorithms that integrate a variety of bioinformatics-derived predictive features, including properties of amino acid sequence changes, evolutionary conservation, location in protein structure and predicted impact on protein structure. taken together, the functional data and the structure prediction suggest that both variants constitute deleterious mutations.   the missense variant series (k1487r, s1613c, m1652i, q1826h, and v1833m) was evaluated for transactivation activity exclusively in the context of stringent reporters ( 4a) as previously defined for missense variants [12, 14–16].  variants s1613c, m1652i, and q1826h exhibited activity significantly higher than 50% of the wt activity and are likely to constitute neutral variants ( 4a). differences in activity could not be accounted for by differences in protein levels, as expression of fusion constructs did not necessarily correlate with activity ( 4b).    4  4 functional analysis of missense variants in brca1 table 1 summarizes the results obtained when the missense variants located at the brct region (m1652i, q1826h, and v1833m) were rationalized based on our structural models.  variant v1833m is predicted to disrupt the hydrophobic core of the brct domain. in addition, methionine is larger than valine, so this replacement likely disrupts the tight packing in the hydrophobic core of the brct-c domain.  on the other hand, we found no evidence for functional impact in variants m1652i and q1826h.  residue q1826 in brct-c is on the protein surface and its side chain points outward to the solvent. neutral and deleterious variants display > 50% or < 45% of wild type activity, respectively.  in this context, variants s1613c, m1652i and q1826h are likely to represent neutral variants.  variant m1652i is documented as a validated csnp (rs1799967) in ncbi’s snp database (http://www. thus, taken together, the functional and computation prediction data presented here and the published data from multiple independent sources indicate that the m1652i constitutes a neutral variant.  there is no additional available data for q1826h.   the k1487r variant exhibits an amino acid change (lys to arg) with no alteration in charge and with large resemblance in structure in a position that allows glycine in rodent species.  in conclusion, we analyzed a series of missense, frameshift, and in-frame deletion variants of brca1 for which clinical information was not available or not informative.  using a combination of functional analysis and structural predictions we tentatively classify variants v1833m, 5673insc and δ exons 16/17 as likely to be deleterious and missense variants m1652i, s1613c, and q1826h as likely to be neutral.  genetic screening of the breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene brca1 has uncovered a large number of variants of uncertain clinical significance.
2644 ||  the m18t and t37r variants did not complement the hdr assay.  variants that could complement the hdr activity were i21v, i31m, i42v, l52, d67y, and r71g.   we tested whether the mutant brca1 proteins used in this study could bind to bard1 (figure 5). purified proteins were analyzed by immunoblots specific for the ha-epitope to evaluate the effectiveness of expression and purification of the mutant brca1 protein and specific for the endogenous bard1 protein.  we found that brca1 variant proteins i21v, i31m, i42v, l52f, d67y, and r71g effectively purified cellular bard1 protein.  these are the same proteins that functioned in homologous recombination. of the 16 brca1 variants in this study, four of the eight zn-coordinating residues have been classified as deleterious when mutant (table 1).  one other variant, r71g, has been classified as deleterious (2, 20), and one, d67y, had been classified as neutral (4).  one of the substitution mutants, m18t, has a published odds ratio of being deleterious of 31:1 (4).  genetic analysis of one of these mutants, d67y, has suggested that it is neutral with regard to cancer predisposition (4), and consistent with that notion it has the same phenotype as does wild-type brca1 in the hdr assay.  though the r71g substitution is considered cancer-promoting, the mutation is thought to affect the splicing of the mrna (20), such a feature would be missed when expressing a cdna as in this experiment.  mutant brca1(r71g) protein functioned in the hdr at similar levels as did wild-type brca1.  when a brca1 variant protein is defective in the homologous recombination process, is it cancer associated? so far, the results indicate a strong correlation with this hdr assay and cancer predisposition, but the analysis of more mutants will be important to determine whether there is an association.  conversely, are brca1 variants that have full hdr activity neutral mutations? the r71g variant has full hdr activity, but it is certainly cancer-associated but via splicing (20), a mechanism that would not be identified in this assay using fully spliced cdnas.  thus, we already have one example indicating that the converse is not true. as the data become more complete, such results will likely become an excellent resource for guiding clinical decisions.    in a brca1 screening in familial breast cancer carried out in different centres in spain, france, and united kingdom, a missense mutation 330a>g which results in a arg to gly change at codon 71 (r71g) was independently identified in 6 families, all of them with spanish ancestors.  this residue coincides with the -2 position of the exon 5 donor splice site. the sequence analysis of the cdna indicated that 22 bp of exon 5 were deleted, creating with the first bases of exon 6 a termination codon at position 64, which results in a truncated protein.  the brca1 haplotype of the r71g carrier patients and spanish controls was analysed by use of six microsatellites located within or near brca1.  our results are consistent with the possibility that these families shared a common ancestry with brca1 r71g being a founder mutation of spanish origin. the presence of founder effects, leading to reduced genetic heterogeneity, facilitates carrier detection and genetic counselling for certain well-defined populations.  we describe a new brca1 r71g mutation, interesting for two reasons: a) it is a founder mutation most likely of spanish origin and b) this apparently missense mutation has in fact pathological implications on brca1 exon 5 splicing.  patients and methods genotyping as part of familial bc studies carried out in different centres in spain, france, and the united kingdom, germ-line brca1 mutations have been sought in families with family history of bc and/or oc and in women with early-onset bc, accrued through genetic-counselling clinics in these hospitals. analysis of the entire coding and flanking sequences was carried out by a combination of sscp and protein truncation test (ptt), followed by sequencing of abnormal bands.  haplotyping the haplotype of the brca1 r71g carrier patients, and 60 spanish chromosome controls was analysed by use of six brca1-linked microsatellite markers (thra1, d17s800, d17s855, d17s1323, d17s1327, and d17s579) (neuhausen  1996).  the amplified markers were transferred to a nylon membrane and hybridized with a modified 5'(ca)n probe using the ecl labelling system (amersham). estimated allele sizes were compared with those reported previously (neuhausen  1996).  results a missense mutation in nucleotide 330 (exon 5) which would be predicted to cause an r71g change was identified independently in six families.  (figure 1 shows the pedigrees of mutation carriers). sequencing exon 5 of brca1 in genomic dna from the probands revealed a substitution of an a nucleotide with a g at position 330 in one of the two alleles.  this 330a>g mutation, which results in amino acid change at codon 71 (r71g), occurs at the 3’ end of exon 5 of brca1.  this residue coincides with the -2 position of the exon 5 donor splice site. although many are likely to be associated with cancer susceptibility, in the absence of functional assays they should be regarded as missense changes of unknown significance.  the mutation r71g is a base substitution in nucleotide 330 resulting in a shift in codon 71 from agg to ggg.  the transition predicts an amino acid change (arg>gly), but since it affects the penultimate adenine residue of the splice donor consensus, it may be expected to have more drastic effects on mrna splicing of exons 5 and 6. this is the second most common outcome of mutational events of this type (krawczak  1992).  in this study, we show the pathological effect of the r71g brca1 mutation, which results in a truncated protein.  although the are differences in the number of cases in the six families, mainly due to the small number of relatives and available samples in three spanish families, the penetrance of the mutation seems to be very high.  however, women carrying the r71g mutation in these families express a variety of phenotypes: from early-onset bilateral bc (families gal5, gal7, and b81) to oc (families gal4, gal5 and fr).  there are 18 cases of bc that could be associated with the mutation, the majority of them diagnosed before the 40 years of age (mean = 36 years, range = 27- 48 years). the wide cancer spectrum of these families suggests that other environmental factors, modifying genes, or different predisposing gene(s) segregating within the families may also be involved.  the brca1 r71g mutation has been observed in families in diverse geographical locations (spain, caribbean, france, united kingdom) who would appear to be of spanish origin, and it co-segregates with cancer in those families (t. frank, personal commun. our results are consistent with the possibility that the families studied shared a common ancestry with brca1 330a>g being a founder mutation of spanish origin.  therefore, the study of the brca1 r71g mutation may be a productive approach to the study of susceptibility in bc/oc families originating from galicia in spain.  this is an example of a single-base substitution effect that can be misclassified. class 4 is likely pathogenic (probability of being pathogenic is –), and class 5 is definitely pathogenic (probability >).  according to variants described in the [lindor  (2012)] system, three of the variants in this study (m18t, c61g, and m1775r) were of class 4, either likely pathogenic or definitely pathogeni an additional five mutants are treated clinically as class 5, pathogenic, (c39y, c44f, c47g, c64g, and r71g).  one of these pathogenic mutants, r71g, does not affect the brca1 protein, but rather the splicing of the mrna [vega , 2001].  since the assays tested express brca1 from spliced cdna, the r71g defective phenotype would not be detected.  we thus exclude this mutant from the comparison of benchmarking these assays against known mutants.  go to: discussion functional assays as predictive tools for assessing brca1 variants  in this study, we analyzed a total of 29 brca1 variants in the repair of dsbs by homologous recombination and by ssa.  for the sake of this discussion, we exclude the brca1–r71g variant that affects splicing [vega , 2001] because all of our assays used prespliced cdnas and would not be sensitive to a splicing defect.  by comparing our results with those brca1 missense substitutions that have a known effect on breast cancer predisposition, we found that the hdr assay was 100% accurate: seven previously classified pathogenic mutants were defective for hdr, and eight previously classified nonpathogenic variants in brca1 were functional for hdr.
2645 ||  results sift and polyphen prediction programs identify probably deleterious nonsynonymous missense variants the mutational analysis of 276 hereditary breast and ovarian cancer families, performed by automatic direct sequencing of all coding regions and intron–exon boundaries, has revealed several novel as well as previously described variants of brca1 gene.  by using two prediction software programs, sift and polyphen, seven nonsynonymous variants likely disrupting the gene function, n132 k, y179c, n550 h, s1164i, s1512i, i1766s, a1789 t, were identified.  among those, two variants, the 3610g4t (3491g4t, s1164i) and the 5484g4a (5365g4a, a1789 t), were studied for the first time in this analysis; the variant 5416t4g (5295t4g, i1766s) has been classified as deleterious mutation by other studies [carvalho , 2007]. the affected cousin was found negative for the variants (supplementary  s1 and s2).  the variant s1164i was detected in family pi397, also the carrier of the e1172x brca1 deleterious mutation.  the proband was unaffected, but her mother and three of her mother’s sisters were affected by ovarian cancer; moreover, four third-degree relatives were affected by breast and ovarian cancer. the underlying assumption is that inheritance of a genuine high-risk missense substitution in brca1, along with a clearly deleterious table 1.  description of the brca1 missense variants analyzed brca1 varianta systematic nomenclatureb number of families harboring the variant siftc polyphend bice pathogenicity previous classification 477g4a, d120n 358g4a 1   0 null not classified 515c4a, n132k 396c4a 1 0  1 damaging neutral [easton , 2007] 655a4g, y179cf 536a4g 2   35 damaging probably neutral [judkins , 2005] 1118a4g, t333a 999a4g 1   0 null not classified 1575t4c, f486lf 1456t4c 2   37 null neutral [judkins , 2005] 1767a4c, n550hf 1648a4c 2   35 probably deleterious probably neutral [judkins , 2005] 2576t4c, s819p 2457t4c 1   0 null not classified 3147c4t, p1010s 3028c4t 1   0 null not classified 3610g4t, s1164i 3491g4t 1   0 damaging not classified 4654g4t, s1512i 4535g4t 2   50 damaging neutral [tavtigian , 2006] 5075g4a, m1652i 4956g4a 4   39 probably neutral neutral tavtigian , 2006] 5416t4g, i1766s 5295t4g 1   5 damaging deleterious [carvalho , 2007] 5484g4a, a1789t 5365g4a 1   0 probably deleterious not classified a dna mutation nomenclature is as used in the bic database (http://research. nhgri. we evaluated the co-occurrence in our sample of 276 families.  only the variant s1164i was found to co-occur in a family (family pi397) in which a deleterious mutation was found.  this variant co-occurs with the stop mutation e1172x in all six individuals we tested in the family, so we supposed that it is localized in the same allele (in cis), with respect to the deleterious mutation. the colonies from the brca1-expressing strain contained an average of 7,000 cells per colony; on the other hand, colonies carrying the empty vector contained an average of 459,000 cells per colony ( 2c).  the missense variants c61g, n132 k, y179c, f486l, n550 h, p1010s, s1164i, and s1512i did not complement the growth suppression phenotype, in fact the average number of cells per colony ranged from 4,000 to 22,000 ( 2c), but they could not be classified as neutral because they map outside the brct domains.  the three brct mutants a1708e, i1766s, and a1789 t fully inhibited the growth suppression, as the number of cells per colony ranged from 402,000 to 457,500. the expression of missense variants carrying mutation within the dna binding and brct domain gave quite different results.  the expression of the f486l, n550 h, and p1010s mutants did not increase recombination, while the expression of the s1164i variant showed a significant increase of both intraand interchromosomal recombination ( 3a and b).  the s1512i variant did not have any influence on yeast recombination, nor did the brct variant a1789 t. cerevisiae could be a useful genetic tool to classify brca1 missense variants as deleterious.  particularly, our results indicated that the variants n132 k, y179c, s1164i, and i1766s should be assessed as potentially deleterious, and the n550 h and s1512i variant as neutral.  the a1789 t variant might also be deleterious, although it did not affect hr as it showed a clear effect on cell growth inhibition and clinical data showed cosegregation with disease in the family and wild-type allele inactivation in the tumor sample.
2646 ||  d1739e, m1783t and v1833m were predicted by these rules to be likely benign replacements, whereas the scp assay indicates possible functional and/or structural defects.  conversely, the structure-based algorithm predicts a deleterious effect of v1804d, a mutation that shows a similar scp to wild type brca1.  of particular interest is the modest aspartate to glutamate substitution at residue 1739, between the two brct repeats. all but one (v1653m) alter residues incompletely conserved between the orthologs of eight vertebrate species and, in fact, three result in substitution of a residue allowed in another species at the corresponding position (t1720i, v1804a, p1806a).  with one exception (v1804d49), the scp assay predictions for these alleles are consistent with all other available predictions.  thus, the evidence favors assignment of these variants as benign polymorphisms. this confirmation of the potential value of the scp assay highlights the need to understand its biochemical basis.  this understanding table 1 mutations characterized in this study secondary structure, predicted structural references for functional mutation allowed residues* detected in humans consequences predictions upstream of brct l1600e l n unknown k1601e k n “ lk1600/01ee lk n “ k1606e q, k, r y “ a1608v a, e y “ s1613c s, n y “ 40 a1615d a n “ m1628v m, s, v, r y “ m1628t m, s, v, r y “ p1637l p y “ 42 a164it a, s y “ brct region m1652t m, i, f y adjacent to β sheet 1, brct-n 32, 40#, 50 m1652k m, i, f n “ 32, 38, 40#, 49, 50 v1653m v y “ 49, 50 s1655f s y “ 50 t1720a t, v, i y α helix 3, brct-n 38#, 49, 50 t1720i t, v, i n “ 38#, 49, 50 v1736a v y between brct domains 38#, 49 d1739e d y “ 49 d1739g d y “ 49, 50 m1775r m y α helix 1, brct-c/ 31-34, 36, 37, 40, 49, 51 surface, disrupts interface m1783t m, i y α helix 1, brct-c/ 34, 49-51 intrahelical, destabilizes fold g1788v g y loop between α helix 1 32, 34, 44#, 49-51 and β sheet 2, brct-c, incorrect folding v1804a v, t, a, s n loop between β 51 sheets 2 and 3, brct-c v1804d v, t, a, s y “ 49-51 p1806a p, l, a, s y “ 38, 49, 50 v1808a v y β sheet 3, brct-c, 34, 49-51 destabilizes fold v1810g v y “ 49, 50 n1819y n, s, a, t, r n α helix 2, brct-c 49, 51 v1833m v y β sheet 4, brct-c, 34, 38#, 49-51 destabilizes fold y1853x y y 11 residue truncation those italicized and underlined abrogate the small colony phenotype, and thus are predicted to negatively affect brca1 structure and/or function.  *upstream of brct: allowed residues in mammals;

breast cancer information core database), and two (l1564p and v1804d) in both ethnic groups (30, 31).   figure 1 figure 1 location of variants in brca1. cells were cotransformed with a lexa-responsive β-galactosidase reporter gene (diagram shown above the graph) and a lexa dbd fusion to residues .  sixteen ucvs in the brctdomains (s1655f, l1664p, t1700a, g1706e, v1713a, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, l1764p, i1766s, g1788d, q1785h, e1794d, v1804d, and p1806a) were also tested.  variants s1655f, t1700a, g1706e, v1713a, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, l1764p, and 1766s displayed markedly decreased activity with <40% of the wt activity in yeast and <20% in mammalian cells ( 2a and b). the q1785h and e1794d variants displayed activity comparable to wt in both yeast and mammalian cells.  variants l1664p and v1804d showed activity comparable to the wt in yeast but ∼60% to 80% in mammalian cells, whereas variant p1806a showed activity comparable to the wt in mammalian cells but reduced (64%) in yeast cells.  finally, variant g1788d showed between 30% and 40% activity in yeast or mammalian cells.  as a first approach, we arbitrarily considered >80% and <40% of wt activity as the thresholds to classify the variants as neutral or deleterious, respectively (12).  using this threshold, our data indicate that (a) v1534m, p1614s, e1644g, q1785h, and e1794d do not represent high-risk variants and are likely to be neutral; (b) s1655f, t1700a, g1706e, v1713a, v1736a, g1738r, g1738e, r1753t, l1764p, and i1766s represent deleterious/high-risk variants; (c) variants r1443g, l1546n, l1564p, l1664p, v1804d, and p1806a do not represent high-risk variants, although we cannot rule out the possibility that they may represent moderate-risk variants; and (d) variant g1788d does not represent a neutral variant, although we cannot rule out the possibility that it may represent a moderate-risk variant instead of a deleterious one.  importantly, despite variation in levels in yeast and mammalian assays, no variant presented clearly conflicting results (>80% in one test and <40% in another). two specimens from the left breast tumor showed loh of the mutant allele and one specimen from the right breast tumor showed no loh.   v1804d for family 1008, only two individuals affected with breast cancer were tested and both were shown to carry the variant.  the proband's paternal side on family 922 is native american. 29).  therefore, we analyzed eight variants (l1564p, p1614s, t1700a, v1713a, q1785h, g1788d, e1794d, and v1804d) that have been found in african americans and/or hispanics (30, 31, 42).   using the threshold of activity defined in  4 (>50% for neutrals and <45% for deleterious), variants t1700a, v1713a, and g1788d displayed activity compatible with a deleterious classification, whereas l1564p, p1614s, q1785h, e1794d, and v1804d displayed activity compatible with a neutral classification ( 4). 17).  structural analysis supports a neutral classification for q1785h and v1804d and a deleterious classification for t1700a, v1713a, and g1788d (table 2).  interestingly, the t1700 residue is part of the phosphoserine binding pocket in which it makes hydrogen bonding interactions with the serine hydroxyl group, and it may play an important role in binding specificity (35, 36, 41).

2657 ||  three of them are exposed on the face away from the putative binding site proposed above, whereas the remaining five mutations are conservative changes in the core of the fold (table 1 ⇓ ;  2 ⇓ ).  five mutations (g1706a, s1715n, f1761i, m1775v, and a1843t) in the total set of 37, with impact on the transcriptional activation function that is known, could not be readily explained.  possible reasons for the inability to explain these mutants are discussed in detail in supplementary table 3. missense variants a1669s, c1697r, r1699w, r1699q, a1708e, s1715r, g1738e and a truncating mutation, w1837x, were characterized using yeast- and mammalian-based transcription assays.  in addition, four additional missense variants (v1665m, d1692n, s1715n, and d1733g) and one in-frame deletion (v1688del) were included in the study.  our findings demonstrate that transactivation activity may reflect a tumor suppressing function of brca1 and further support the role of brca1 missense mutations in disease predisposition. s1715 is an evolutionarily conserved residue.  however, the disease pattern in lund 184 (harboring a s1715r substitution; variant s1715n was also analyzed, see below) is not satisfactorily explained by a mutation in brca1 alone because it presents an uncharacteristic phenotype.  multiple cases of colon cancer might suggest the involvement of a mismatch repair gene defect. however, more information is still needed for a reliable characterization of this variant.  variants v1688del and s1715n displayed loss of activity suggesting that they represent cancer-associated mutations (table 1).  alteration v1688del is an in-frame deletion of a conserved hydrophobic residue predicted to be part of β3 in the brct-n domain (29). previous mutation analysis has underscored the importance of hydrophobic residues for the function of brca1 (24).  similar to s1715r (lund 184) the substitution s1715n (bic) resulted in loss of activity in the assay.  fusion protein and promoter stringency do not influence assay outcome to rule out the possibility that the results obtained with the gal4 dbd fusions were dependent on the dna binding domain, we also performed the experiments using fusions to lexa dbd in the saccharomyces cerevisiae strain egy48 (24). author manuscript author manuscript author manuscript author manuscript considering the excellent correspondence between genetic alterations associated with breast and ovarian cancer in families and those that abolish transactivation, we tentatively characterized several additional brca1 unclassified variants.  we propose that variants v1665m, d1692n, and d1733g represent benign polymorphisms and variants v1668del and s1715n represent disease-associated mutations.  final characterization of these variants must await independent confirmation.

2661 ||  this outcome leads to problems in risk assessment, counseling and preventive care.  the purpose of the present study was to functionally evaluate seven unclassified variants of brca1 including a genomic deletion that leads to the in-frame loss of exons 16/17 (δ exons 16/17) in the mrna, an insertion that leads to a frameshift and an extended carboxy-terminus (5673insc), and five missense variants (k1487r, s1613c, m1652i, q1826h and v1833m).  we analyzed the variants using a functional assay based on the transcription activation property of brca1 combined with supervised learning computational models.  functional analysis indicated that variants s1613c, q1826h, and m1652i are likely to be neutral, whereas variants v1833m, δ exons 16/17, and 5673insc are likely to represent deleterious variants.  in agreement with the functional analysis, the results of the computational analysis also indicated that the latter three variants are likely to be deleterious. those include a deletion of exons 16 and 17 (δ exons 16/17), an insertion mutation (5673insc) leading to a frameshift that produces a protein which is 15 amino acids longer than the wild type, and missense variant q1826h.  four missense variants (k1487r, s1613c, m1652i and v1833m) previously reported in the bic database were also functionally evaluated.  we provide a bioinformatics-based prediction of their impact, and for the variants that affect the brca1 cooh-terminal (brct) domains (δ exons 16/17, 5673insc, m1652i, q1826h and v1833m) we also provide a rationalization of their impact, based on structural modeling. constructs  constructs coding for exons 13–24 (amino acids 1396–1863) of wild-type (wt) brca1, positive (s1613g; neutral), and negative (m1775r and y1853x; deleterious) controls were previously described [14–16].  mutations were generated by splicing by overlapping extension pcr [20] using p385-brca1 [14] (for δ exons 16/17, k1487r, s1613c, q1826h, m1652i, and v1833m) or f3-brca1 [1] (for 5673insc) as template.  pcr products were cloned into plex9 or pgbt9 vectors.  we also analyzed five additional unclassified missense variants ( 1a).  two of them (k1487r, s1613c) were chosen in order to increase coverage of the unstructured region of brca1 cooh-terminus and test the hypothesis that variants outside conserved domains are likely to be neutral.  the remaining three (m1652i, q1826h and v1833m) are missense variants in the brct domain and were chosen because they have been previously analyzed for binding to phosphopeptides (m1652i and v1833m)[31, 33], or exposed at the surface of the domain (q1826h) which represents a class of poorly studied variants [18]. taken together, the functional data and the structure prediction suggest that both variants constitute deleterious mutations.   the missense variant series (k1487r, s1613c, m1652i, q1826h, and v1833m) was evaluated for transactivation activity exclusively in the context of stringent reporters ( 4a) as previously defined for missense variants [12, 14–16].  variants s1613c, m1652i, and q1826h exhibited activity significantly higher than 50% of the wt activity and are likely to constitute neutral variants ( 4a). neutral and deleterious variants display > 50% or < 45% of wild type activity, respectively.  in this context, variants s1613c, m1652i and q1826h are likely to represent neutral variants.  variant m1652i is documented as a validated csnp (rs1799967) in ncbi’s snp database (http://www.gov/snp/) with  of heterozygosity.  variant s1613c failed to activate transcription in yeast using a less sensitive qualitative assay, providing a cautionary note to the interpretation of functional assays [49].  interestingly, variant s1613c is located at the same residue as one of the most common neutral polymorphisms in brca1, s1613g.  in conclusion, we analyzed a series of missense, frameshift, and in-frame deletion variants of brca1 for which clinical information was not available or not informative.  using a combination of functional analysis and structural predictions we tentatively classify variants v1833m, 5673insc and δ exons 16/17 as likely to be deleterious and missense variants m1652i, s1613c, and q1826h as likely to be neutral.

table 1). we then carried out an analysis using interspecific variation, pedigree analysis, and co-occurrence data (table 1).  of the seven variants for which the method based on interspecific variation was able to reach a conclusion, the data confirmed the classification based on our functional tests in six cases (l1407p, h1402y, t1685i, g1706a, g1788v, and w1837r) but presented a contradiction for variant m1628v.  the pedigree analysis confirmed our results for brca bilat 42 m brca 29 m brca 35 m brca 55 m prophylactic mastectomy lund 897 m = v1809f 1 brca 41 brca 66 brca 55 brca 44 wt m wt wt m brca 54 brca 51 cl-8 m = t1720a 3 brca 81 brca 85 wt f92 m = t1720a brca 55 brca 44 m brca 40 m wt brca 48 brca 49 ov 54 t334 m = m1628t brca 52 brca? 52 m wt wt m wt m m m m wt wt wt m 6-99-006 m = g1706a 2 brca65 br 44-54 brca 87 ov 45 brca 53 m792 m = w1837r othca 70 (colon?) prostate leukaemia? 78 m brca 40? sto cns? 42 brca 39 homcs 57 ovarian disgerminoma 27 m ovcs 58 bladder 53 wt brca 52 wt brca > 70? figure 3 pedigrees of missense variants in brca1. in order to further cross validate our analysis we compared it with results from three published methods to classify variants in the brct domain (table 1).  the first method is table 1 comprehensive analysis of brca1 variants exon mutation nucleotide change* allowed residues  txn` iv1 pdg ps** st   bic`` co11 comments 13 h1402y c4323t hdynk # # nd na na 1 1 reduces the probability to form coiled coil   structure from  to  13 l1407p t4339c l n ? nd na na 1 0 conserved stretch;

however, given that fact that pedigree analysis, transcriptional activation, and protease sensitivity indicate a high risk variant, our conclusion is that, although the change is a conservative one, the side chain size threshold in the algorithm needs to be refined.  in summary, we have classified six missense variants (l1407p, m1628v, t1685i, a1752p, g1788v, and v1809f) as probable deleterious/high risk variants and the remainder as probable neutral/low clinical significance variants (h1402y, h1421y, s1512i, m1628t, and t1720a), with two variants (g1706a and w1837r) left unclassified.  previously, all the known deleterious missense changes were in the ring domain or brct repeats.
2671 ||  it is conceivable therefore that the charge repulsion of p53 l3 loop drives the flexible linker loop toward the charge attraction of the h2 helix.   figure 4 figure 4 snapshots of the brca1-p53 interface from the wild type, f1695l and d1733g at 0 ns and 10 ns.  the top panel is the wild type brca1-p53 interface, where the r1744 at the linker region drifts away from crowded la loop region from 0 ns to 10 ns. mutations of 1694 and 1695 are on the la loop, which provides a unique contact region of brca1 with p53 comparing to 53bp1, are designed for probing the steric hindrance of the brca1 la loo a mutant with two mutations at 1737 and at 1744 was also designed to compare with the single point mutations at each of these sites.  four of these thirteen mutants, f1695l, n1730s, d1733g, and f1734s are carcinogenic; these are the only known carcinogenic mutations of brca1 which are in contact with residues with p53 in our modeled complex.  interestingly, f1695 and d1733 are not conserved between brca1 and 53bp1, whilst n1730 and f1734 are conserved. the direct consequence of the conformational change is the loss of the contact between the brca1 linker with the p53 l2 loop, thus the interaction of p53 and brca1 brct is weakened.   to test whether the la loop is responsible for the flexibility of brca1-p53 interface, two mutations e1694k and f1695l, have been performed in the la loo as shown in figure 5, the e1694k avoided the two arginine residue situation, p53 r248 and brca1 r1744, stabilizing the linker loop during the first 6 ns, however, the repulsion of the lysine and linker region arginine r1744 finally causes structural fluctuation of the linker region, as shown in the rmsf plot (figure 6), increasing the rmsd of e1694k significantly after 6 ns.  although f1695l is not directly connected to the interaction at the linker region, leucine is less likely to cause steric hindrance than the bulky phenylalanine. the more negative the δδg, the stronger the brca1-p53 binding it implies; and, smaller values of the rmsd of the complex interface suggest more stable interface.  comparing to wild type brca1, mutants f1695l and d1733g have the most negative δδg, suggesting stronger binding with p53 than the wild type brca1 in this orientation.  in addition, these two mutants have the smallest average rmsd values. interestingly, these two mutants are the only cancer-related mutants among all the mutants simulated according to the national human genome research institute (nhgri) breast cancer mutation database.  considering that the binding energy of f1695l mutants with p53 is more negative and the average rmsd value is smaller than d1733g, we predict that among these thirteen mutants, f1695l could be the mutant candidate to most stabilize the interface of brca1-p53 complex in the conformation similar to the 53bp1-p53 complex.   table 1 table 1 comparison of the binding energy and interface average cα rmsd for brca1 mutants bound to p53. however, it is not clear how strong such a binding of the brca1 central region with the p53 c-terminal domain is.   f1695l is the mutant that stabilizes the complex the most among these thirteen mutants probably since phenylalanine prevents the movement of arg248.  if phenylalanine is replaced by a hydrophobic yet more flexible residue, it allows the arg248 side chain to rotate away from arg1744 thus preventing the drifting of the linker residues, retaining the contact of the linker with the l3 loo f1695l is breast cancer related mutation.  thus the prediction that the f1695l mutation stabilizes the brca1-p53 complex may provide some insight into the association and its role in breast cancer.  d1733g, another cancer associated mutant, also stabilizes the complex interface to some degree because it avoids attracting a positively charged residue from the brca1 loop region thus preventing accumulation of positive charge around the p53 l3 loo taken together, by stabilizing the unwanted interactions, the p53 binds brca1 in a way similar to the p53-53bp1 binding pattern, thus falling into a “similarity trap”. that is, the two carcinogenic mutants strongly disturbed the native functions.   apart from the proposed mechanism, the f1695l mutation may also disrupt another important binding with bach1 (joo, ,2002).  the brca1 brct domain has recently been identified as phospho-protein binding domain with evidence of its interaction with phosphorylated dna helicase bach1 as well as ctbp interacting protein (ctip) (clapperton, ,2004, manke, ,2003, varma, ,2005, williams, ,2004, yu, ,2003). the interaction sites are different from the interaction sites we explored for brca1-p53 interaction.  it has been found that the f1695l mutation can reduce the interaction between brca1 brct with bach1.  based on this discovery, joo  initially hypothesized that the la loop is one of the interaction regions with bach1 (joo, ,2002), but the solved structure of brca1-bach1 complex shows that the la loop is not involved in this interaction, lending support to our proposed mechanism. it is possible that brca1 initially participates in stabilization and accumulation of p53 protein by forming transient complex with p53, and then is free to interact with bach1.  with the cancer-related mutation f1695l, the unregulated “similarity trapped” brca1-p53 binding prevents the brca1 interaction with bach1.   go to: conclusions our molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the interaction of brca1 brct domain with p53 core domain is weaker than that of 53bp1 in a similar binding mode despite their conserved structures. two of these four, n1730 and f1734 are conserved between brca1 and 53bp1, and two f1695 and d1733 are not conserved.  interestingly, it is the two non-conserved carcinogenic mutants, f1695l and d1733g, which enforced the binding of p53 core domain with brca1-brct domain in a way similar to that with 53bp1 protein.  therefore, we propose that the known binding pattern in p53-53bp1 interaction is a “similarity trap” that nature has to avoid in the p53-brca1 interactions.
2673 ||  classification of these variants into pathogenic or non-pathogenic type is an important challenge in genetic diagnosis and counseling.  the aim of the present study is to functionally assess a set of 7 missense vus (q1409l, s1473p, e1586g, r1589h, y1703s, w1718l and g1770v) located in the c-terminal region of brca1 by combining in silico prediction tools and structural analysis with a transcription activation (ta) assay.  the in silico prediction programs gave discrepant results making its interpretation difficult. structural analysis of the three variants located in the brct domains (y1703s, w1718l and g1770v) reveals significant alterations of brct structure.  the ta assay shows that variants y1703s, w1718l and g1770v dramatically compromise the transcriptional activity of brca1, while variants q1409l, s1473p, e1586g and r1589h behave like wild-type brca1.  in conclusion, our results suggest that variants y1703s, w1718l and g1770v can be classified as likely pathogenic brca1 mutations. our results indicate that three of them (y1703s, w1718l, g1770v) have significant functional impact and may represent pathogenic brca1 variants while the remaining four do not have a functional impact.   go to: materials and methods brca1 vus  seven missense brca1 c-terminal variants (q1409l, s1473p, e1586g, r1589h, y1703s, w1718l and g1770v), identified through genetic testing of patients with suspicion of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (hbocs) as part of the hereditary cancer program of the catalan institute of oncology, were included in this study (figure 1).  written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. table 1 shows the outcomes of all methods, for comparison with high discrepancy between different programs.  the two integrative algorithms indicate that variants q1409l, s1473p, e1586g and r1589h have a benign effect and that g1770v has a damaging effect, whereas they disagree in their predictions for variants y1703s and w1718l.  furthermore the results of pon-p and condel for q1409l and g1770v strikingly diverge from those of align-gvgd, which classify q1409l as most likely to interfere with brca1 function and g1770v as less likely using the alignment from human to frog. the luciferase activity of these three mutants was very similar to that observed for the known pathogenic mutants used as controls: that is <5%, compared to the wild-type construct.  conversely, the remaining four vus (q1409l, s1473p, e1586g and r1589h) displayed similar transcriptional activity to that of the wild-type construct.   figure 2 figure 2 results of functional assay of the studied missense variants. the variants selected were vus identified in a clinical scenario, which are located between amino acid residues 1,396 and 1,863 of the full-length brca1 sequence and include part of a coiled-coil domain (aa 1,364–1,437) and the brct tandem domains (aa 1,646–1,863) (figure 1).  notably, six of the vus (q1409l, s1473p, e1586g, y1703s, w1718l and g1770v) had not been recorded in the locus-specific database for mutations in brca1 and brca2, bic (breast cancer information core database, http://research. nhgri.  the use of different in silico prediction algorithms gave contradictory results for some of the variants (table 1) making it difficult to draw any clear conclusion.  for example, there is a striking difference between the results for three versions of polyphen-2 as run from different sources; w1718l can yield probabilities of pathogenicity of ,  and , while the probabilities for q1409l, s1473p and e1586g range from values below  to values above  in the different versions.  if we tried to order the variants according to their deleteriousness as predicted from each of the algorithms, they would yield as many orders as algorithms tested.  in general terms, the two integrative programs gave quite similar results, predicting a damaging effect for one of the variants (g1770v) and a benign effect for four of them (q1409l, s1473p, e1586g and r1589h), while variants y1703s and w1718l were difficult to classify.  therefore, attending to the results obtained in this study, we consider the use of in silico programs not reliable enough to get an approximation of the pathogenicity of a given vus.

2677 ||  three of them are exposed on the face away from the putative binding site proposed above, whereas the remaining five mutations are conservative changes in the core of the fold (table 1 ⇓ ;  2 ⇓ ).  five mutations (g1706a, s1715n, f1761i, m1775v, and a1843t) in the total set of 37, with impact on the transcriptional activation function that is known, could not be readily explained.  possible reasons for the inability to explain these mutants are discussed in detail in supplementary table 3.
2679 ||  in contrast to the tumorigenic mutations examined above, polymorphisms of brca1 do not predispose to cancer and are thought to have no influence on gene function.  s1613g and m1652i are common polymorphisms (refs.  21 and 25 and m. luce, personal communication), and m1652i alters a conserved residue (11) of the first brct domain (8).  yeast transformed by pad–brca1–δ2 modified by s1613g or m1652i formed small colonies identical in size and number of cells per colony to pad–brca1–δ2 transformants ( (33 b and c).  protein expression levels were similar for all constructs by western blotting.  thus, s1613g and m1652i had no effect on growth inhibition, consistent with their classification as polymorphisms.   the correlation between disease-associated mutations of brca1 and abrogation of growth inhibition suggested that this assay may be used to assess the functional significance of unclassified brca1 mutations.
